RisingWave allows you to query PostgreSQL tables directly with the `postgres_query` table-valued function (TVF). It offers a simpler alternative to Change Data Capture (CDC) when working with PostgreSQL data in RisingWave. 

Unlike CDC, which continuously syncs data changes, this function lets you fetch data directly from PostgreSQL when needed. Therefore, this approach is ideal static or infrequently updated data, as it's more resource-efficient than maintaining a constant CDC connection.

**PUBLIC PREVIEW**

This feature is in the public preview stage, meaning it's nearing the final product but is not yet fully stable. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please contact us through our [Slack channel](https://www.risingwave.com/slack). Your input is valuable in helping us improve the feature.

## Syntax

Define `postgres_query` as follows:

```sql
postgres_query(
    hostname varchar,      -- Database hostname
    port varchar,          -- Database port
    username varchar,      -- Authentication username
    password varchar,      -- Authentication password
    database_name varchar, -- Target database name
    query varchar          -- SQL query to execute
)
```

## Example

1. In your PostgreSQL database, create a table and populate it with sample data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (id bigint primary key, x int);
INSERT INTO test SELECT id, id::int FROM generate_series(1, 100) AS t(id);
```

2. In RisingWave, use `postgres_query` function to retrieve rows where `id > 90`.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM postgres_query('localhost', '5432', 'postgres', 'postgres', 'mydb', 'SELECT * FROM test WHERE id > 90;');
----RESULT
91 91
92 92
93 93
94 94
95 95
96 96
97 97
98 98
99 99
100 100
```
