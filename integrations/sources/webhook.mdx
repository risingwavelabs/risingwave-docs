description: Describes how to ingest data from webhook to RisingWave.
---

A webhook is a mechanism that enables real-time data transfer between applications by sending immediate notifications when specific events occur. Instead of continuously polling for updates, applications can receive data automatically, making it an efficient way to integrate with third-party services.

RisingWave can serve as a webhook destination, directly accepting HTTP requests from external services and storing the incoming data in its tables. By default, the frontend node listens for webhook events on port `4560`. You can reconfigure this depending on how your cluster is deployed. When a webhook is triggered, RisingWave processes and ingests the data in real-time.

This direct integration eliminates the need for an intermediary message broker like Kafka. Instead of setting up and maintaining an extra Kafka cluster, you can directly send data to RisingWave to process it in real-time, which enables efficient data ingestion and stream processing without extra infrastructure.

## Creating a webhook table in RisingWave

To utilize webhook sources in RisingWave, you need to create a table configured to accept webhook requests. Below is a basic example of how to set up such a table:

```sql
-- Create a secret to store the webhook validation key. Note that this is optional but recommended. 
-- Alternatively you can use a raw string (without specifying `SECRET <secret>`).
CREATE SECRET test_secret WITH (backend = 'meta') AS 'secret_value'; 

CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook',
  [ is_batched = true ]
) VALIDATE SECRET test_secret AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'{header of signature}',
  {signature generation expressions}
);
```

| Parameter or clause | Description |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| `CREATE SECRET` | Securely stores a secret value in RisingWave for request validation. |
| `CREATE TABLE` | Defines a table with a JSONB column to store webhook payload data. |
| `connector` | Configures the table to accept incoming HTTP webhook requests. |
| `is_batched` | Optional, set to `true` to enable batch ingestion of multiple JSON lines in a single request. |
| `VALIDATE SECRET...AS...` | Authenticates requests using the stored secret and signature comparison. |
| `secure_compare()` | Validates requests by matching the header signature against the computed signature, ensuring only authenticated requests are processed. Note `secure_compare(...)` is the only supported validation function for webhook tables. |
| `header_of_signature` | Specifies which HTTP header contains the incoming signature. |
| `signature_generation_expressions` | Expression to compute the expected signature using the secret and payload. |

<Note>
`is_batched` is added in v2.5.0 and is currently in **[technical preview](/changelog/product-lifecycle#product-release-lifecycle)** stage.
</Note>

Currently, secret management is a premium feature. You can also use raw string for verification. The following example use raw string `'secret_value'` to compute signature.

```sql
create table wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook',
) VALIDATE AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'x-hub-signature',
  'sha1=' || encode(hmac('secret_value', data, 'sha1'), 'hex')
);
```

## Supported webhook sources and authentication methods
RisingWave has been verified to work with the following webhook sources and authentication methods:

|webhook source|Authentication methods|
| :-- | :-- |
|GitHub| SHA-1 HMAC, SHA-256 HMAC |
|Segment| SHA-1 HMAC |
|HubSpot| API Key, Signature V2 |
|AWS EventBridge| Bearer Token |
|Rudderstack| Bearer Token |

Here are step-by-step guide to help you set up and configure your webhook sources:

- [Ingest from Github webhook](/integrations/sources/github-webhook)
- [Ingest from Segment webhook](/integrations/sources/segment-webhook)
- [Ingest from HubSpot webhook](/integrations/sources/hubspot-webhook)
- [Ingest from Amazon EventBridge webhook](/integrations/sources/eventbridge-webhook)
- [Ingest from RudderStack webhook](/integrations/sources/rudderstack-webhook)

<Note>While only the above sources have been thoroughly tested, RisingWave can support additional webhook sources and authentication methods. You can integrate other services using similar configurations.</Note>

## Deploy RisingWave webhook listener

Learn how to deploy and test RisingWave's webhook listener using open-source tools such as **Kubernetes Operator** and **Helm Chart**.

### Kubernetes operator

<Info>Make sure risingwave-operator ≥ [v0.12.0](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/releases/tag/v0.12.0).</Info>

1. Prepare a YAML manifest of RisingWave with the following field set:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: risingwave.risingwavelabs.com/v1alpha1
    kind: RisingWave
    metadata:
      name: risingwave
    spec:
      enableWebhookListener: true
    ```

    You can try with the [base YAML](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/blob/main/docs/manifests/stable/persistent/minio/risingwave.yaml). 

2. Apply the YAML to create RisingWave.

**Endpoint (intra-Kubernetes)**

The endpoint depends on the object name and namespace:

```bash
Example: risingwave-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local:4560
Format: <service name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>:4560
```

### Helm Chart

<Info>Make sure Helm chart ≥ [0.2.38](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/helm-charts/releases/tag/risingwave-0.2.38).</Info>

1. Prepare a YAML values of RisingWave with the following field set:

    ```yaml
    frontendComponent:
      webhookListener: true
    ```

2. Install a Helm release with the values.

    ```bash Example command
    helm install --set tags.bundle=true,frontendComponent.webhookListener=true risingwave risingwavelabs/risingwave --version 0.2.38
    ```

**Endpoint (intra-Kubernetes)**

Depending on the release name and namespace:

```bash
Example: risingwave.default.svc.cluster.local:4560
Format: <service name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>:4560
```

### Test webhook locally (Helm + Local)

To test the webhook locally using Helm, first install a Helm release using the example command provided in [Helm Chart](/integrations/sources/webhook#helm-chart). For local testing, it is recommended to use Orbstack on macOS or cloud testing clusters on other platforms. Once the Helm release is running, follow these steps:

1. Forward ports of the RisingWave to local
    
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/risingwave 4560,4567
    ```
    
2. Connect with `psql` and create a demo table.
    
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -p 4567 -d dev -U root
    dev=> CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
      data JSONB
    ) WITH (
      connector = 'webhook'
    ) VALIDATE AS secure_compare (
      headers->>'signature',
      '1'
    );
    CREATE_TABLE
    ```

3. Send sample data with `curl`
    
    ```bash
    curl -v -X POST http://localhost:4560/webhook/dev/public/wbhtable \
                  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                  -H "signature: 1" \
                  -d '{
            "event": "user.signup",
            "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:30:00Z",
            "data": {
              "user_id": "12345",
              "email": "test@example.com",
              "name": "John Doe"
            }
          }'
    ```
    
4. Go back to step 2 and query from the table.
    
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -p 4567 -d dev -U root
    dev=> select * from wbhtable;
                                                                         data
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     {"data": {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "John Doe", "user_id": "12345"}, "event": "user.signup", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:30:00Z"}
    (1 row)
    ```
