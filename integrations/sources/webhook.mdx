description: Describes how to ingest data from webhook to RisingWave.
---

A webhook is a mechanism that enables real-time data transfer between applications by sending immediate notifications when specific events occur. Instead of continuously polling for updates, applications can receive data automatically, making it an efficient way to integrate with third-party services.

RisingWave can serve as a webhook destination, directly accepting HTTP requests from external services and storing the incoming data in its tables. By default, the frontend node listens for webhook events on port `4560`. You can reconfigure this depending on how your cluster is deployed. When a webhook is triggered, RisingWave processes and ingests the data in real-time.

This direct integration eliminates the need for an intermediary message broker like Kafka. Instead of setting up and maintaining an extra Kafka cluster, you can directly send data to RisingWave to process it in real-time, which enables efficient data ingestion and stream processing without extra infrastructure.

## Creating a webhook table in RisingWave

To utilize webhook sources in RisingWave, you need to create a table configured to accept webhook requests. Below is a basic example of how to set up such a table:

<Warning>
Secret management is a premium feature. If you don't have access to secrets, skip Option A and use Option B (SQL string literal) instead.
</Warning>

```sql
-- Option A (recommended): store the shared key as a RisingWave secret, and reference it via
-- `VALIDATE SECRET <secret_name>`.
CREATE SECRET test_secret WITH (backend = 'meta') AS 'secret_value';

CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook',
  [ is_batched = true ]
) VALIDATE SECRET test_secret AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'{header_of_signature}',
  {signature_generation_expressions}
);
```

| Parameter or clause | Description |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| `CREATE SECRET` | Securely stores a secret value in RisingWave for request validation. |
| `CREATE TABLE` | Defines a table with a JSONB column to store webhook payload data. |
| `connector` | Configures the table to accept incoming HTTP webhook requests. |
| `is_batched` | Optional, set to `true` to enable batch ingestion of multiple JSON lines in a single request. |
| `VALIDATE SECRET...AS...` | Authenticates requests using the stored secret and signature comparison. |
| `secure_compare()` | Validates requests by matching the header signature against the computed signature, ensuring only authenticated requests are processed. Note `secure_compare(...)` is the only supported validation function for webhook tables. |
| `header_of_signature` | Specifies which HTTP header contains the incoming signature. |
| `signature_generation_expressions` | Expression to compute the expected signature using the secret and payload. |


```sql
-- Option B: use a SQL string literal instead of a secret.
CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook'
) VALIDATE AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'x-hub-signature',
  'sha1=' || encode(hmac('secret_value', data, 'sha1'), 'hex')
);
```

### Webhook endpoint

Webhook requests should be sent to:

`http://<HOST>:4560/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<table>`

The default listening port is `4560`. Replace `<schema>` with `public` if you didn't create the table under a custom schema.

### Quick local smoke test (no upstream SaaS required)

If you can access RisingWave's webhook listener and SQL endpoint (for example, via local deployment or port-forwarding), you can do a quick end-to-end test with `curl`:

1. Create a demo table that accepts requests with header `signature: 1`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook'
) VALIDATE AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'signature',
  '1'
);
```

2. Send one event to RisingWave.

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://<HOST>:4560/webhook/<database>/public/wbhtable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "signature: 1" \
  -d '{"event":"user.signup","data":{"user_id":"123"}}'
```

3. Query the table to verify ingestion.

```sql
SELECT * FROM wbhtable;
```

## Supported webhook sources and authentication methods
RisingWave has been verified to work with the following webhook sources and authentication methods:

|webhook source|Authentication methods|
| :-- | :-- |
|GitHub| SHA-1 HMAC, SHA-256 HMAC |
|Segment| SHA-1 HMAC |
|HubSpot| API Key, Signature V2 |
|AWS EventBridge| Bearer Token |
|Rudderstack| Bearer Token |

Here are step-by-step guides to help you set up and configure your webhook sources:

- [Ingest from Github webhook](/integrations/sources/github-webhook)
- [Ingest from Segment webhook](/integrations/sources/segment-webhook)
- [Ingest from HubSpot webhook](/integrations/sources/hubspot-webhook)
- [Ingest from Amazon EventBridge webhook](/integrations/sources/eventbridge-webhook)
- [Ingest from RudderStack webhook](/integrations/sources/rudderstack-webhook)

<Note>While only the above sources have been thoroughly tested, RisingWave can support additional webhook sources and authentication methods. You can integrate other services using similar configurations.</Note>

## Deploy RisingWave webhook listener

Learn how to deploy and test RisingWave's webhook listener using open-source tools such as **Kubernetes Operator** and **Helm Chart**.

### Kubernetes operator

<Info>Make sure risingwave-operator ≥ [v0.12.0](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/releases/tag/v0.12.0).</Info>

1. Prepare a YAML manifest of RisingWave with the following field set:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: risingwave.risingwavelabs.com/v1alpha1
    kind: RisingWave
    metadata:
      name: risingwave
    spec:
      enableWebhookListener: true
    ```

    You can try with the [base YAML](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/blob/main/docs/manifests/stable/persistent/minio/risingwave.yaml). 

2. Apply the YAML to create the RisingWave instance.

**Endpoint (intra-Kubernetes)**

Depending on the object name and namespace, the endpoint is typically:

```bash
Example: risingwave-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local:4560
Format: <service name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>:4560
```

### Helm Chart

<Info>Make sure Helm chart ≥ [0.2.38](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/helm-charts/releases/tag/risingwave-0.2.38).</Info>

1. Prepare a YAML values of RisingWave with the following field set:

    ```yaml
    frontendComponent:
      webhookListener: true
    ```

2. Install a Helm release with the values.

    ```bash Example command
    helm install --set tags.bundle=true,frontendComponent.webhookListener=true risingwave risingwavelabs/risingwave --version 0.2.38
    ```

**Endpoint (intra-Kubernetes)**

Depending on the release name and namespace, the endpoint is typically:

```bash
Example: risingwave.default.svc.cluster.local:4560
Format: <service name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>:4560
```

### Test webhook locally using Helm

To test the webhook locally using Helm, first install a Helm release using the example command provided in [Helm Chart](/integrations/sources/webhook#helm-chart).

Once the Helm release is running, follow these steps:

1. Forward ports of the RisingWave to local
    
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/risingwave 4560,4567
    ```
    
2. Connect with `psql` and create a demo table.
    
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -p 4567 -d dev -U root
    dev=> CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
      data JSONB
    ) WITH (
      connector = 'webhook'
    ) VALIDATE AS secure_compare (
      headers->>'signature',
      '1'
    );
    CREATE_TABLE
    ```

3. Send sample data with `curl`
    
    ```bash
    curl -v -X POST http://localhost:4560/webhook/dev/public/wbhtable \
                  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                  -H "signature: 1" \
                  -d '{
            "event": "user.signup",
            "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:30:00Z",
            "data": {
              "user_id": "12345",
              "email": "test@example.com",
              "name": "John Doe"
            }
          }'
    ```
    
4. Query from the table and check the result.
    
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -p 4567 -d dev -U root
    dev=> select * from wbhtable;
                                                                         data
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     {"data": {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "John Doe", "user_id": "12345"}, "event": "user.signup", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T08:30:00Z"}
    (1 row)
    ```
