description: "You can sink data from RisingWave to [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/). As [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) can work as a drop-in replacement for Cassandra, it means you can sink data from RisingWave to ScyllaDB as well."
---

This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to Cassandra or ScyllaDB using the Cassandra sink connector in RisingWave.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure your Cassandra or ScyllaDB cluster is accessible from RisingWave.
* If you are running RisingWave locally from binaries and intend to use the native CDC source connectors or the JDBC sink connector, make sure that you have [JDK 11](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/) or later versions is installed in your environment.

## Syntax[](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

To sink data to Cassandra or ScyllaDB, create a Cassandra sink in RisingWave using the syntax below:

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
    connector='cassandra',
    type='<type>',
    cassandra.url = '<node1>,<node2>,<node3>',
    cassandra.keyspace = '<keyspace>',
    cassandra.table = '<cassandra_table>',
    cassandra.datacenter = '<data_center>'
);
```

Once the sink is created, data changes will be streamed to the specified table.

## Parameters

| _sink\_name_                   | Name of the sink to be created.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| _sink\_from_                   | A clause that specifies the direct source from which data will be output. `sink_from` can be a materialized view or a table. Either this clause or `select_query` query must be specified.                              |
| AS _select\_query_             | A SELECT query that specifies the data to be output to the sink. Either this query or a `sink_from` clause must be specified. See [SELECT](/sql/commands/sql-select) for the syntax and examples of the SELECT command. |
| type                           | Required. Specify if the sink should be upsert or append-only. If creating an upsert sink, you must specify a primary key.                                                                                                |
| primary\_key                   | Optional. A string of a list of column names, separated by commas, that specifies the primary key of the Cassandra sink.                                                                                                  |
| force\_append\_only            | If true, forces the sink to be append-only, even if it cannot be.                                                                                                                                                         |
| cassandra.url                  | Required. The URL or IP address of the Cassandra or ScyllaDB cluster or node you want to connect to.                                                                                                                      |
| cassandra.keyspace             | Required. The name of the keyspace within the Cassandra database or ScyllaDB where you want to store the data. A keyspace is a logical container for organizing data in Cassandra.                                        |
