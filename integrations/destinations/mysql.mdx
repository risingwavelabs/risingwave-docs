description: This guide will introduce how to sink data from RisingWave to JDBC-available databases using the JDBC sink connector.
---

MySQL is a commonly used RDS with a JDBC driver and it is available as a cloud database through AWS for easy setup and maintenance. We will show you how to configure MySQL and RisingWave to create a MySQL sink. The configurations for RisingWave when connecting to any JDBC-available database will be the same.

<Note>
The supported MySQL versions are 5.7 and 8.0.x
</Note>

## Set up a MySQL database
<Tabs>
   <Tab title="AWS RDS">
Before using the native MySQL CDC connector in RisingWave, you need to complete several configurations on MySQL.

### Set up a MySQL RDS instance on AWS

1. Log in to the AWS console. Search “RDS” in services and select the **RDS** panel.

</Frame>

2. Create a database with **MySQL** as the **Engine type**. We recommend setting up a username and password or using other security options.

</Frame>
3. When the new instance becomes available, click on its panel.

</Frame>

4. From the **Connectivity** panel, we can find the endpoint and connection port information.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/connectivity.png"/>
</Frame>

### Connect to the RDS instance from MySQL

Now we can connect to the RDS instance. Make sure you have installed MySQL on your local machine, and start a MySQL prompt. Fill in the endpoint, the port, and login credentials in the connection parameters.

```bash
mysql -h rw-to-mysql.xxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u <username> -p <password>
```

For more login options, refer to the [RDS connection guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER%5FConnectToInstance.html).

### Set up a destination table

Use the following query to set up a database and a table in the RDS instance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_db.personnel (
 id integer,
 name varchar(200),
 PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

If the creation is successful, expect a returned message.

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)
```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Self-hosted MySQL">
### Connect to MySQL

Connect to your MySQL server. See the [Connect to MySQL server](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/connect-to-mysql-server/) guide for more details.

### Set up destination table

Use the following queries to set up a database and table in MySQL.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_db;

USE test_db;

CREATE TABLE personnel (
 id integer,
 name varchar(200),
 PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
   </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set up RisingWave

### Install and launch RisingWave

To install and start RisingWave locally, see the [Get started](/get-started/quickstart) guide. We recommend running RisingWave locally for testing purposes.

### Notes about running RisingWave from binaries
If you are running RisingWave locally from binaries and intend to use the native CDC source connectors or the JDBC sink connector, make sure you have [JDK 11](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/) or later versions installed in your environment.

## Create a sink

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='jdbc',
   field_name = 'field', ...
);
```

## Sink data from RisingWave to MySQL

### Create a table and sink

To sink to MySQL, make sure that RisingWave table and the MySQL table share the same table schema. Use the following queries in RisingWave to create a table and sink.

The `jdbc.url` must be accurate. The format varies slightly depending on if you are using AWS RDS MySQL or a self-hosted version of MySQL. If your MySQL is self-hosted, the `jdbc.url` would have the following format: `jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/testdb?user=<username>&password=<password>`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE personnel (
 id integer,
 name varchar,
);

CREATE SINK s_mysql FROM personnel WITH (
 connector='jdbc',
 jdbc.url='jdbc:mysql://<aws_rds_endpoint>:<port>/test_db',
 user='<username>',
 password='<password>',
 table.name='personnel',
 type = 'upsert',
 primary_key = 'id'
);
```

### Update the table

Insert some data with the following query. Remember to use the `FLUSH` command to commit the update.

```sql
INSERT INTO personnel VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

FLUSH;
```

### Verify the sink connection

The changes will then be synced to MySQL. To verify the update, connect to MySQL and query the table. The changes you made to the table should be reflected.

```sql
SELECT * FROM personnel;

+------+-------+
| id   | name  |
+------+-------+
|    1 | Alice |
+------+-------+
|    2 | Bob   |
+------+-------+
```

## Data type mapping

For the MySQL data type mapping table, see the [Data type mapping table](/integrations/sources/mysql-cdc#data-type-mapping) under the Ingest data from MySQL CDC topic.

Additional notes regarding sinking data to MySQL:

* Array data types in RisingWave when sinked to MySQL will be converted to a string. Only one-dimensional arrays can be sinked to MySQL. For instance, `ARRAY['Value 1', 'Value 2']` when sinked to MySQL will be converted to the string `Value 1, Value 2`.
* For array type, we only support `smallint`, `integer`, `bigint`, `real`, `double precision`, and `varchar` type now.
* It's better to set `connectionTimeZone=UTC` in `jdbc.url` to get the correct `timestamptz` type data. For more details, see [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-usagenotes-known-issues-limitations.html).
