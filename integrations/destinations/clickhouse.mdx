<Tip>
**Try our SQL generator tool!** We've built an interactive tool to help you generate SQL statements for creating sinks. Check it out at [https://sql.risingwave.com/sink/clickhouse](https://sql.risingwave.com/sink/clickhouse).
</Tip>

ClickHouse is a high-performance, column-oriented SQL database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing (OLAP). For more information about ClickHouse, see [ClickHouse official website](https://clickhouse.com).

## Prerequisites

* Ensure you already have a ClickHouse table that you can sink data to. For additional guidance on creating a table and setting up ClickHouse, refer to this [quick start guide](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
* Ensure you have an upstream materialized view or source that you can sink data from.

<Note>
We highly recommend using the deduplication engine, like ReplacingMergeTree, in ClickHouse. This is because it addresses the potential problem of duplicate writes in ClickHouse during RisingWave recovery when primary keys can be duplicated.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='clickhouse',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...

| clickhouse.table             | **Required**. Name of the ClickHouse table that you want to sink data to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| commit\_checkpoint\_interval | **Optional**. Commit every N checkpoints (N > 0). Default value is 10. <br/>The behavior of this field also depends on the `sink_decouple` setting:<ul><li>If `sink_decouple` is true (the default), the default value of `commit_checkpoint_interval` is 10.</li> <li>If `sink_decouple` is set to false, the default value of `commit_checkpoint_interval` is 1.</li> <li>If `sink_decouple` is set to false and `commit_checkpoint_interval` is set to larger than 1, an error will occur.</li></ul> |
| clickhouse.delete.column     | **Optional**. You can run an upsert sink using the ReplacingMergeTree engine. When using the ReplacingMergeTree engine, you can specify the delete column with this parameter.                      |

## Upsert sinks

While RisingWave supports `append-only` sinks for all ClickHouse engines, support for `upsert` sinks is limited. Additionally, for ReplacingMergeTree engines, an `append-only` sink will not insert duplicate data.

RisingWave supports `upsert` sinks for the following ClickHouse engines:

* CollapsingMergeTree: `DELETE` operations are transformed into `INSERT with SIGN = -1`.
* VersionedCollapsingMergeTree: `DELETE` operations are transformed into `INSERT with SIGN = -1`.
* ReplacingMergeTree: `DELETE` operations are transformed into `INSERT with SIGN = 1`.

## Supported table engines

RisingWave supports the following table engines of ClickHouse:

* MergeTree
* ReplacingMergeTree
* SummingMergeTree
* AggregatingMergeTree
* CollapsingMergeTree
* VersionedCollapsingMergeTree
* GraphiteMergeTree
* ReplicatedMergeTree
* ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree
* ReplicatedSummingMergeTree
* ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree
* ReplicatedCollapsingMergeTree
* ReplicatedVersionedCollapsingMergeTree
* ReplicatedGraphiteMergeTree
* SharedMergeTree
* SharedReplacingMergeTree
* SharedSummingMergeTree
* SharedAggregatingMergeTree
* SharedCollapsingMergeTree
* SharedVersionedCollapsingMergeTree
* SharedGraphiteMergeTree

Among these, engines prefixed with "Shared" are exclusively available in ClickHouse Cloud and are premium features in RisingWave. They provide enhanced capabilities for distributed deployments, automatic replication, and improved resource management. For more information about it, see [MergeTree Engine Family
](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family).

<Tip>
**PREMIUM FEATURE**

This is a premium feature. For a comprehensive overview of all premium features and their usage, please see [RisingWave premium features](/get-started/premium-features).
</Tip>

## Load data with `COPY TO STDOUT`

ClickHouse will automatically use the PostgreSQL-compatible `COPY` command to load data from RisingWave. For more details on the `COPY` command, see [COPY](/sql/commands/sql-copy).

## Examples

This section includes several examples that you can use if you want to quickly experiment with sinking data to ClickHouse.

### Create a ClickHouse table (if you do not already have one)

For example, let's consider creating a basic ClickHouse table with the primary key as `seq_id` and the ENGINE set to `ReplacingMergeTree`. It's important to emphasize that without using `ReplacingMergeTree` or other deduplication techniques, there is a significant risk of duplicate writes to ClickHouse.

Note that only S3-compatible object store is supported, such as AWS S3 or MinIO.

```sql
CREATE TABLE demo_test(
    seq_id Int32,
    user_id Int32,
    user_name String
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
PRIMARY KEY (seq_id);
```

### Create an upstream materialized view or source

The following query creates an append-only source. For more details on creating a source, see [CREATE SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-create-source).

```sql
CREATE SOURCE s1_source (
    seq_id integer,
    user_id integer,
    user_name varchar)
WITH (
    connector ='datagen',
    fields.seq_id.kind ='sequence',
    fields.seq_id.start ='1',
    fields.seq_id.end ='10000000',
    fields.user_id.kind ='random',
    fields.user_id.min ='1',
    fields.user_id.max ='10000000',
    fields.user_name.kind ='random',
    fields.user_name.length ='10',
    datagen.rows.per.second ='20000'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

Another option is to create an upsert table, which supports in-place updates. For more details on creating a table, see [CREATE TABLE](/sql/commands/sql-create-table) .

```sql
CREATE TABLE s1_table (
    seq_id integer,
    user_id integer,
    user_name varchar)
WITH (
    connector ='datagen',
    fields.seq_id.kind ='sequence',
    fields.seq_id.start ='1',
    fields.seq_id.end ='10000000',
    fields.user_id.kind ='random',
    fields.user_id.min ='1',
    fields.user_id.max ='10000000',
    fields.user_name.kind ='random',
    fields.user_name.length ='10',
    datagen.rows.per.second ='20000'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

### Append-only sink from append-only source

If you have an append-only source and want to create an append-only sink, set `type = append-only` in the `CREATE SINK` SQL query.

```sql
CREATE SINK s1_sink FROM t1_table
WITH (
    connector = 'clickhouse',
    type = 'append-only',
    clickhouse.url = '${CLICKHOUSE_URL}',
    clickhouse.user = '${CLICKHOUSE_USER}',
    clickhouse.password = '${CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}',
    clickhouse.database = 'default',
    clickhouse.table='demo_test'
);
```

### Append-only sink from upsert source

If you have an upsert source and want to create an append-only sink, set `type = append-only` and `ignore_delete = true` (or its alias `force_append_only = true`). This will ignore delete messages in the upstream, and turn upstream update messages into insert messages.

```sql
CREATE SINK s1_sink FROM t1_table
WITH (
    connector = 'clickhouse',
    type = 'append-only',
    clickhouse.url = '${CLICKHOUSE_URL}',
    clickhouse.user = '${CLICKHOUSE_USER}',
    clickhouse.password = '${CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}',
    clickhouse.database = 'default',
    clickhouse.table='demo_test'
);
```

### Upsert sink from upsert source

If you have an upsert source and want to create an upsert sink, set `type = upsert`. When the sink type is upsert, be sure to set the `primary_key` field to specify the primary key of the downstream ClickHouse table.

```sql
CREATE SINK s1_sink FROM s1_table
WITH (
    connector = 'clickhouse',
    type = 'upsert',
    primary_key = 'seq_id',
    clickhouse.url = '${CLICKHOUSE_URL}',
    clickhouse.user = '${CLICKHOUSE_USER}',
    clickhouse.password = '${CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}',
    clickhouse.database = 'default',
    clickhouse.table='demo_test'
);
```

<Note>
You can also set `ignore_delete = 'true'` with upsert sinks to prevent DELETE operations from being sent to ClickHouse while still allowing inserts and updates. This is useful for preventing accidental data deletion.
</Note>

In ClickHouse, the `Nested` data type doesn't support multiple levels of nesting. Therefore, when sinking RisingWave's `struct` data to ClickHouse, you need to flatten or restructure the nested data to align with ClickHouse's requirement.

Before v1.9, when inserting data into a ClickHouse sink, an error would be reported if the values were "nan (not a number)", "inf (infinity)", or "-inf (-infinity)". Since v1.9, we have made a change to this behavior. If the ClickHouse column is nullable, we will insert null values in such cases. If the column is not nullable, we will insert `0` instead.

Please be aware that the range of specific values varies among ClickHouse types and RisingWave types. Refer to the table below for detailed information.

| ClickHouse type | RisingWave type | ClickHouse range     | RisingWave range       |
