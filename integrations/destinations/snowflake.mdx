sidebarTitle: Snowflake
description: This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to Snowflake using the Snowflake sink connector in RisingWave.
---

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that allows for scalable and efficient data storage and analysis. For more information about Snowflake, see [Snowflake official website](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

Sinking from RisingWave to Snowflake utilizes [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-apis) for data loading. Initially, data is staged in a user-managed S3 bucket in JSON format, and then loaded into the Snowflake table via Snowpipe. For more information, see [Overview of the Snowpipe REST endpoints to load data](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-overview).

**PREMIUM EDITION FEATURE**

This is a Premium Edition feature. All Premium Edition features are available out of the box without additional cost on RisingWave Cloud. For self-hosted deployments, users need to purchase a license key to access this feature. To purchase a license key, please contact sales team at [sales@risingwave-labs.com](mailto:sales@risingwave-labs.com).

</Tip>

## Prerequisite

* Ensure you have an S3 bucket that RisingWave can connect to.
* Ensure you have an upstream materialized view or source in RisingWave that you can sink data from.
* Ensure the S3 user account has `WRITE` permission.
* Ensure that Snowflake and S3 are set up in the same manner as described in the [Automating Snowpipe for Amazon S3](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3), as RisingWave is only responsible for writing data to S3.

<Note>
RisingWave will not be responsible for deleting data already imported by S3\. You can manually set the lifecycle configuration of your S3 bucket to clear out unnecessary data. See [Lifecycle configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html) and [Delete staged files](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-manage#deleting-staged-files-after-snowpipe-loads-the-datafor) for more details.
</Note>

## Syntax
Use the following syntax to create a sink in RisingWave:

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='snowflake',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Example

Here is an example on how you can sink data from RisingWave to Snowflake.

### Set up S3

Set up an external S3 bucket and ensure you have the corresponding credentials. Both Snowflake stage and RisingWave sink creation require these credentials:

* `snowflake.s3_bucket`: URL in Snowflake stage.
* `snowflake.aws_access_key_id`: AWS\_KEY\_ID in Snowflake stage.
* `snowflake.aws_secret_access_key`: AWS\_SECRET\_KEY in Snowflake stage.

### Set up Snowflake

Next, you need to set up a table, a stage, and a pipe. Additionally, make sure to open the SQS queue in S3.

To complete the setup, follow the instructions in [Automating Snowpipe for Amazon S3](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3).

### Sink data with append-only

Now you can start sinking data. Launch your RisingWave cluster and execute the following SQL queries to create source and sink. See the examples below:

```sql Create source
CREATE SOURCE s1_source (id int,name varchar)
WITH (
	connector ='datagen',
	fields.id.kind ='sequence',
	fields.id.start ='1',
	fields.id.end ='10000',
	fields.name.kind ='random',
	fields.name.length ='10',
	datagen.rows.per.second ='200'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

```sql Create sink
CREATE SINK snowflake_sink FROM ss_mv WITH (
    connector = 'snowflake',
    type = 'append-only',
    s3.bucket_name = 'EXAMPLE_S3_BUCKET',
    s3.credentials.access = 'EXAMPLE_AWS_ACCESS',
    s3.credentials.secret = 'EXAMPLE_AWS_SECRET',
    s3.region_name = 'EXAMPLE_REGION',
    s3.path = 'EXAMPLE_S3_PATH',
    force_append_only = 'true'
);
```

### Sink data with upsert

Snowflake tables don't support direct updates. To handle this, RisingWave imports incremental logs and modification order for each data piece into Snowflake. You can then merge these as you read, or create dynamic tables to read the upsert results. See [How dynamic tables work](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) for more details.

Below are some examples for your reference.

```sql Create source in RisingWave
CREATE SOURCE s1_source (id int,name varchar)
WITH (
    connector ='datagen',
    fields.id.kind ='sequence',
    fields.id.start ='1',
    fields.id.end ='10000',
    fields.name.kind ='random',
    fields.name.length ='10',
    datagen.rows.per.second ='200'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

```sql Create materialized view in RisingWave
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ss_mv AS
WITH sub AS changelog FROM user_behaviors
SELECT
    user_id,
    target_id,
    event_timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'America/Indiana/Indianapolis' as event_timestamp,
    changelog_op AS __op,
    _changelog_row_id::bigint AS __row_id
FROM
    sub;
```

Note that RisingWave uses `changelog` to transform streaming data into incremental logs. In the example above, `changelog_op` represents the type of modification (Insert/Update/Delete), while `_changelog_row_id` indicates the order of the modification. For more information, see [AS CHANGELOG](/sql/commands/sql-as-changelog).

```sql Create sink in RisingWave
CREATE SINK snowflake_sink FROM ss_mv WITH (
   connector = 'snowflake',
   type = 'append-only',
   s3.bucket_name = 'EXAMPLE_S3_BUCKET',
   s3.credentials.access = 'EXAMPLE_AWS_ACCESS',
   s3.credentials.secret = 'EXAMPLE_AWS_SECRET',
   s3.region_name = 'EXAMPLE_REGION',
   s3.path = 'EXAMPLE_S3_PATH',
);
```

```sql Create warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE test_warehouse;
```

```sql Create dynamic table in Snowflake
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE user_behaviors
TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'
WAREHOUSE = test_warehouse
AS SELECT *
   FROM (
       SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY {primary_key} ORDER BY __row_id DESC) AS dedupe_id
       FROM t3
   ) AS subquery
WHERE dedupe_id = 1 AND (__op = 1 or __op = 3);
```
