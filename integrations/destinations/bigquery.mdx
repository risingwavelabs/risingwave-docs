[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en) is Google's fully managed data warehouse and data analytics platform, capable of handling and analyzing large volumes of data as it is highly scalable.

You can test out this process on your own device by using the `big-query-sink` demo in the [integration\_test directory](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/tree/main/integration%5Ftests) of the RisingWave repository.

## Prerequisites

Before sinking data from RisingWave to BigQuery, please ensure the following:

* The BigQuery table you want to sink to is accessible from RisingWave.
* Ensure you have an upstream materialized view or table in RisingWave that you can sink data from.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='bigquery',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Parameters

## Examples

We can create a BigQuery sink with a local JSON key file.

```sql
CREATE SINK big_query_sink_local
FROM mv1
WITH (
    connector = 'bigquery',
    type = 'append-only',
    bigquery.local.path= '${bigquery_service_account_json_path}',
    bigquery.project= '${project_id}',
    bigquery.dataset= '${dataset_id}',
    bigquery.table= '${table_id}',
    force_append_only='true'
);
```

Or we can create a BigQuery sink with an S3 JSON key file.

```sql
CREATE SINK big_query_sink_s3
FROM mv1
WITH (
    connector = 'bigquery',
    type = 'append-only',
    bigquery.s3.path= '${s3_service_account_json_path}',
    bigquery.project= '${project_id}',
    bigquery.dataset= '${dataset_id}',
    bigquery.table= '${table_id}',
    aws.credentials.access_key_id = '${aws_access_key}',
    aws.credentials.secret_access_key = '${aws_secret_access}',
    region = '${aws_region}',
    force_append_only='true',
);
```
