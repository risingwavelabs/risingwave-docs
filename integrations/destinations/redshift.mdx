description: This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to Amazon Redshift using the Redshift sink connector.
---

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. The RisingWave Redshift sink connector provides efficient data ingestion with support for automatic schema changes and both S3-based and direct loading methods.


## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='redshift',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter                   | Description |
|:-----------------------------|:------------|
| jdbc.url                     | JDBC URL to connect to Redshift |
| user                         | Redshift username |
| password                     | Redshift password |

**S3 parameters**

These options only need to be set when `with_s3 = true`:

| Parameter                   | Description |
|:-----------------------------|:------------|
| with_s3                      | Enable writing via S3 (default: true) |
| s3.region_name               | AWS region for S3  |
| s3.bucket_name               | S3 bucket name |
| s3.path                      | S3 folder path for sink files |
| enable_config_load           | Load S3 credentials from environment (self-hosted only) |
| s3.credentials.access        | AWS access key ID |
| s3.credentials.secret        | AWS secret access key |
| s3.endpoint_url              | Custom S3 endpoint URL (for self-hosted setups) |
| s3.assume_role               | IAM role ARN to assume for S3 access |


<Note>
In RisingWave Cloud, the default AWS credential provider chain is disabled. Provide `s3.credentials.access` and `s3.credentials.secret` (or use a supported assume-role setup). These credentials cannot be omitted. The `enable_config_load` option is supported only in self-hosted deployments.
</Note>

## Auto schema change

<Tip>
**PREMIUM FEATURE**

This is a premium feature. For a comprehensive overview of all premium features and their usage, please see [RisingWave premium features](/get-started/premium-features).
</Tip>

Redshift sinks support auto schema change to automatically adapt their output schema according to changes in the upstream table. This feature is supported only when [`sink_decoupling`](/delivery/overview#sink-decoupling) is disabled.

Once auto schema change is enabled, if you add new columns to the source table, the sink will automatically update to match the new schema. This reduces manual intervention and makes your data pipelines more robust to schema evolution.

To enable it, set the following option when creating the sink:

```sql
auto_schema_change = true
```

## Configure RisingWave to write to S3

You need to configure how RisingWave authenticates with AWS S3. There are two primary methods:

- Access Key / Secret Key (AK/SK) authentication

This is the default method. Provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key directly in the `CREATE SINK` statement.

```sql
s3.credentials.access = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
s3.credentials.secret = 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
```

- Assume role authentication

For enhanced security, RisingWave can assume an IAM Role in your AWS account to gain temporary credentials for S3 access.

```sql
s3.assume_role = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourRisingWaveS3Role',
enable_config_load = 'true',
```

To use this method, you need to configure an IAM Role in AWS that RisingWave can assume. This involves:
1. Obtaining the RisingWave service ARN from our [support team](mailto:cloud-support@risingwave-labs.com).
2. Creating an IAM policy with the necessary S3 read/write permissions for your bucket and prefix.
3. Configuring the IAM Role's trust policy to allow the RisingWave service ARN to assume it.

## Append-only and upsert modes

Amazon Redshift sink connector supports both `append-only` and `upsert` modes for flexible data handling.

In `upsert` mode, performance is optimized through the use of an intermediate table:

- An intermediate table is created to stage data before merging it into the target table. If `create_table_if_not_exists` is set to true, the table is automatically named `rw_<target_table_name>_<uuid>`.

- Data is periodically merged from the intermediate table into the target table according to the `write.target.interval.seconds` setting.

- By default, an S3 bucket is required to achieve optimal ingestion performance into the intermediate table.

- Alternatively, you can use `INSERT` SQL statements to load data directly into the intermediate table, though this approach is not recommended due to performance drawbacks.

Examples:

1. Redshift sink with S3 writer (Append-only mode)

```sql
CREATE SINK redshift_sink FROM test_table WITH (
    connector = 'redshift',
    type = 'append-only',
    table.name = 'test_table',
    schema = 'RW_SCHEMA',

    -- JDBC configs are always required for Redshift
    jdbc.url = 'jdbc:redshift://...',
    username = '...',
    password = '...',

    -- `with_s3` is default to true. If `with_s3` is set to false (not recommended), you to specify `batch.insert.rows`, and the value must be a power of 2, such as 1024 or 4096.
    with_s3 = true,
    s3.bucket_name = '...',
    s3.region_name = '...',
    s3.path = '...',

    -- Authentication: access key / secret (default)
    s3.credentials.access = '...',
    s3.credentials.secret = '...',

    -- Or assume role (requires cloud support)
    s3.assume_role = '...',
    enable_config_load = 'true',

    -- Defaults (can be overridden)
    auto.schema.change = 'false',
    create_table_if_not_exists = 'false'
);
```

2. Redshift sink with S3 writer (Upsert mode)

```sql
CREATE SINK redshift_sink FROM test_table WITH (
    connector = 'redshift',
    type = 'upsert',
    table.name = 'test_table',
    schema = 'RW_SCHEMA',

    -- Intermediate table required for upsert
    intermediate.table.name = '...',
    -- Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
    write.target.interval.seconds = '...',

    -- JDBC configs are always required for Redshift
    jdbc.url = 'jdbc:redshift://...',
    username = '...',
    password = '...',

    -- `with_s3` is default to true. If `with_s3` is set to false (not recommended), you to specify `batch.insert.rows`, and the value must be a power of 2, such as 1024 or 4096.
    with_s3 = true,
    s3.bucket_name = '...',
    s3.region_name = '...',
    s3.path = '...',

    -- Authentication: access key / secret (default)
    s3.credentials.access = '...',
    s3.credentials.secret = '...',

    -- Or assume role (requires cloud support)
    s3.assume_role = '...',
    enable_config_load = 'true',

    -- Defaults (can be overridden)
    auto.schema.change = 'false',
    create_table_if_not_exists = 'false'
);
```

## Set up Redshift

When configuring RisingWave to write to Redshift, the JDBC user must have appropriate permissions depending on whether the `create_table_if_not_exists` option is enabled.

- If `create_table_if_not_exists` is not enabled, the user must have permissions on the target table:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER ON [table_name] TO [username];
```

These permissions allow RisingWave to read, insert, update, delete, and alter the existing table.

- If `create_table_if_not_exists` is enabled, the user needs the table permissions above plus schema-level permissions to create new tables:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA [schema_name] TO [username];
```

This ensures that RisingWave can create tables in the specified schema when they do not already exist.

## Set up Redshift S3 integration

When using S3 as an intermediate storage for Redshift sinks, you need to configure assume role permissions so that RisingWave can write to the user’s S3 bucket.

1. Permissions for the S3 account configured in RisingWave

The S3 account credentials used in RisingWave must have the following permissions on the target bucket/path:

```
s3:GetObject
s3:ListBucket
s3:PutObject
s3:DeleteObject
```

These permissions allow RisingWave to read, list, write, and delete files in the staging S3 location.

2. Permissions for Redshift to access the S3 account

Redshift itself also needs permissions to read from the same S3 bucket. Grant the following permissions to Redshift’s IAM role:

```
s3:GetObject
s3:ListBucket
```

This allows Redshift to copy data from S3 into the Redshift table.

## Set up S3 IAM and role

To guarantee that the IAM role has sufficient permissions to connect to Redshift and access AWS resources:

1. Attach policy to the IAM Role

Attach the policy `AmazonRedshiftAllCommandsFullAccess` to the role.

2. Configure trusted entities

In the IAM Role trust relationship, allow Redshift service to assume the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "redshift.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Attach the IAM role to Redshift instance

- Navigate to the **Amazon Redshift** service in the AWS Management Console.

- In the left navigation pane, select **Clusters** and choose the cluster you want to configure.

- From the **Actions** menu, select **Manage IAM Roles**, and attach the configured IAM role.
