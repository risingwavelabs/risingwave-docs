description: "This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to NATS subjects using the NATS sink connector in RisingWave. Both NATS and NATS JetStream are supported by this connector."
---

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is an open source messaging system for cloud native applications. It provides a lightweight publish-subscribe architecture for high performance messaging.

[NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) is a streaming data platform built on top of NATS. It enables real-time and historical access to streams of data via durable subscriptions and consumer groups.

## Prerequisites

Before sinking data from RisingWave to NATS or NATS JetStream, please ensure the following:

* The RisingWave cluster is running.
* A NATS or NATS JetStream server is running and accessible from your RisingWave cluster.
* Create a NATS subject that you want to sink data to.
* You have the permission to publish data to the NATS subject.

## Syntax

To sink data from RisingWave to a NATS subject, create a sink using the syntax below:

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='nats',
   server_url='<your nats server>:<port>', [ <another_server_url_if_available>, ...]
   subject='<your subject>',

 -- optional parameters
   connect_mode=<connect_mode>
   username='<your user name>',
   password='<your password>'
   jwt='<your jwt>',
   nkey='<your nkey>',
   type='<sink data type>'
);
```

After the sink is created, RisingWave will continuously sink data to the NATS subject in append-only mode.

<Note>
The NATS sink connector in RisingWave provides at-least-once delivery semantics. Events may be redelivered in case of failures.
</Note>

According to the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats%5Fadmin/jetstream%5Fadmin/naming), stream names must adhere to subject naming rules as well as be friendly to the file system. Here are the recommended guidelines for stream names:

* Use alphanumeric values.
* Avoid spaces, tabs, periods (`.`), greater than (`>`) or asterisks (`*`).
* Do not include path separators (forward slash or backward slash).
* Keep the name length limited to 32 characters as the JetStream storage directories include the account, stream name, and consumer name.
* Avoid using reserved file names like `NUL` or `LPT1`.
* Be cautious of case sensitivity in file systems. To prevent collisions, ensure that stream or account names do not clash due to case differences. For example, `Foo` and `foo` would collide on Windows or macOS systems.
