Since RisingWave is compatible with PostgreSQL, you can easily connect Embeddable to RisingWave by using the PostgreSQL driver.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that [Embeddable](https://embeddable.com) is set up and accessible from the RisingWave cluster.
* Install and start RisingWave. For instructions on how to get started, see the [Quick start guide](/get-started/quickstart).

## Establish the connection

1. **Use the Embeddable [Connections API](https://docs.embeddable.com/data/connect-your-database)** to establish a new connection pointing to your RisingWave instance.
2. For the `connectionName`: choose a unique, friendly name.
3. For `type`: choose 'postgres'.
4. Configure the connection via the `credentials` object:
    * `host`: The hostname or IP address of the RisingWave database.
    * `port`: The port number of the RisingWave database.
    * `database`: The name of the RisingWave database you want to connect to.
    * `user`: The username for accessing the database.
    * `password`: The password associated with the provided username.
5. To confirm your connection works, use Embeddable's [`/test`](https://docs.embeddable.com/data/connect-your-database#testing-your-connection) endpoint.

## Use the connection

Once connected, you will be able to reference your connection in your Embeddable data models. 

```yaml
- name: customers
  data_source: my-risingwave-db # Points to the database connection
```

You can then use these in Embeddable's no-code dashboard builder to add charts and build user-facing analytics experiences.
