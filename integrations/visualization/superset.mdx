title: "Configure Superset to read data from RisingWave"
description: Apache Superset is an open-source data exploration and data visualization software application. As a database, RisingWave can act as a data source for Business Intelligence tools like Apache Superset.

This guide will go over how to:

* Connect RisingWave to Superset.
* Create a dashboard.

## Prerequisites

### Install and start RisingWave

To install and start RisingWave locally, see the [Get started](/get-started/quickstart) guide. We recommend running RisingWave locally for demo purposes.

Connect to a streaming source. For details on connecting to streaming sources and what sources are supported with RisingWave, see [CREATE SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-create-source).

### Install Apache Superset

To install Apache Superset, follow the instructions in [Installing locally using Docker Compose](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose#installing-superset-locally-using-docker-compose). This guide will cover how to install the database driver in Docker, so we recommend installing it using Docker Compose.

## Establish the connection between Superset and RisingWave

### Start Apache Superset

Launch an instance of Apache Superset by following the instructions in [Launch Superset through Docker Compose](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose#3-launch-superset-through-docker-compose). To start Superset, enter `http://localhost:8088` into your web browser.

If it is your first time starting Superset and the webpage asks for a username and password, use `admin` for both.

The following UI page should appear.

### Connect to RisingWave

> Note that, the new version of RisingWave implements a wrapper on top of the original PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy driver. Therefore, we recommend using the connector library [sqlalchemy-risingwave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/sqlalchemy-risingwave) instead of psycopg2.
>
> You can install the driver by running the following commands if it is not already installed in the docker container:
> ```shell
> docker compose exec <your container name> bash
> pip install sqlalchemy-risingwave
> exit
> docker compose restart <your container name>
> ```

1. In Superset, select **Settings > Database connections**.
2. Click **\+ Database**.
3. In the window that pops up, scroll to the bottom and select **"Connect this database with a SQLAlchemy URI string instead."**

4. Fill in SQLAlchemy URI, e.g., `risingwave://root@host.docker.internal:4566/dev`.

5. Click **Connect**.

## Create a dashboard

### Create tables or materialized views in RisingWave

Instead of using Superset to create materialized views or tables, use RisingWave. For this guide, we will create the table `t` and insert some data.

Once RisingWave starts, use the following queries to create the table `t` and insert some values to the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (v float, ts timestamp);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1.0, '2022-11-15 15:35:40'),
(2.1, '2022-11-15 15:36:24'),
(3.5, '2022-11-15 15:37:32'),
(4.2, '2022-11-15 15:38:12'),
(4.2, '2022-11-15 15:38:21');
```

### Create and export tables or materialized views

Export the data from materialized views or tables in RisingWave to Superset:

1. Select **Datasets** then **\+ Dataset**.
2. In the window that pops up, under **Database**, select **RisingWave**.
3. Under **Schema**, select the schema the table or materialized view was created in. By default, they are in the `public` schema.
4. Select the materialized view or table to be exported to Superset. In this guide, we'll select `t`.

Once the materialized view has been added as a dataset, it can be used to create dashboards.

### Create a dashboard in Superset

To create a dashboard based on the table `t`:

1. Click **Create chart**.
2. Select table `t`.
3. Select **Time-series line chart** as the rendering method.
4. Specify `ts` as the time column.
5. Specify `AVG(v)` as the metric.
6. Click **Update chart**. The query results will be rendered into a line chart.
