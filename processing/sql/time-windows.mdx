RisingWave supports three types of time windows:

* Tumble windows
* Hop windows
* Session windows

For tumbling and hopping windows, RisingWave supports them by **time window functions**, `tumble()` and `hop()` respectively. For session window, RisingWave supports it by a special type of window function frame, i.e. `SESSION` frame.

## Time window function

Time window functions are used in the **FROM** clause. They take a table/source/materialized view, a time column and some other arguments as input, and assign each input row a time window by augmenting the row with two new columns: `window_start` and `window_end`. The two augmented columns represent the start and end of time windows respectively.

### `tumble()` time window function

Tumbling windows are contiguous non-overlapping time intervals.

![Tumble time window](/images/tumble_time_window.png)

The syntax of the `tumble()` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] [ * | expression [ AS output_name ] [, expression [ AS output_name ]...] ]
FROM TUMBLE ( table_or_source, time_col, window_size [, offset ] );
```

* _table\_or\_source_ specifies the table/source/materialized view that needs to be assigned with time windows.
* _time\_col_ specifies the column to determine time windows on. It can be in either timestamp or timestamp with time zone format.
Example of timestamp with time zone format: `2022-01-01 10:00:00+00:00`.
* _window\_size_ specifies the size of each time window. It should be a constant value of `INTERVAL` type.
Example: `INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'`. The standard SQL format, which places time units outside of quotation marks (for example, `INTERVAL '2' MINUTE`), is also supported.
* _offset_ is an optional parameter that allows you to shift the starting point of each time window.
Example: `window_size = INTERVAL '10 MINUTES', offset = INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'` will yield time window starts like `2022-01-01 00:12:00+00:00`.

Suppose that we have a table, `taxi_trips`, that consists of these columns: `trip_id`, `taxi_id`, `completed_at`, `distance`, and `duration`.

```bash
 trip_id | taxi_id | completed_at        | distance | duration
---------|---------|---------------------|----------|----------
 1       | 1001    | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 4        | 6
 2       | 1002    | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 6        | 9
 3       | 1003    | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 3        | 5
 4       | 1004    | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 7        | 15
 5       | 1005    | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2        | 4
 6       | 1006    | 2022-07-01 22:05:30 | 8        | 17
```

Here is an example that uses the tumbling time window function.

```sql
SELECT trip_id, taxi_id, completed_at, window_start, window_end
FROM TUMBLE (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '2 MINUTES');
```

The result looks like this:

```bash
 trip_id | taxi_id | completed_at        | window_start        | window_end
---------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 1       | 1001    | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00
 2       | 1002    | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00
 3       | 1003    | 2022-07-01 22:02:10 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00
 4       | 1004    | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00
 5       | 1005    | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00
 6       | 1006    | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00
```

### `hop()` time window function

The `hop()` time window function also assigns each row a time window with a fixed size, which is very similar to `tumble()`, except that the assigned time windows may overlap.

![Hop time window](/images/hop_time_window.png)

See below for the syntax of the `hop()` time window function.

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT] [ * | expression [ AS output_name ] [, expression [ AS output_name ]...] ]
FROM HOP ( table_or_source, time_col, hop_size, window_size [, offset ]);
```

* _table\_or\_source_ specifies the table/source/materialized view that needs to be assigned with time windows.
* _time\_col_ specifies the column to determine time windows on. It can be in either timestamp or timestamp with time zone format.
Example of timestamp with time zone format: `2022-01-01 10:00:00+00:00`.
* _hop\_size_ specifies the size of each hop, _window\_size_ specifies the size of each time window. Both should be constant values of `INTERVAL` type.
For example: `INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'`. The standard SQL format, which places time units outside of quotation marks (for example, `INTERVAL '2' MINUTE`), is also supported.
* _offset_ is an optional parameter that allows you to shift the starting point of each time window.
Example: `window_size = INTERVAL '10 MINUTES', offset = INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'` will yield time window starts like `2022-01-01 00:12:00+00:00`.

Here is an example.

```sql
SELECT trip_id, taxi_id, completed_at, window_start, window_end
FROM HOP (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '1 MINUTE', INTERVAL '2 MINUTES');
```

The result looks like the table below. Note that the number of rows in the result of a hop window function is N times the number of rows in the original table, where N is the window size divided by the hop size.

```bash
 trip_id | taxi_id | completed_at        | window_start        | window_end
---------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 1       | 1001    | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 21:59:00 | 2022-07-01 22:01:00
 1       | 1001    | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00
 2       | 1002    | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00
 2       | 1002    | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 3       | 1003    | 2022-07-01 22:02:10 | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 3       | 1003    | 2022-07-01 22:02:10 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00
 4       | 1004    | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00
 4       | 1004    | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00
 5       | 1005    | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00
 5       | 1005    | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:07:00
 6       | 1006    | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:07:00
 6       | 1006    | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00
```

### Session windows

In RisingWave, session windows are supported by a special type of window function frame: `SESSION` frame. You can refer to [Window function calls](/sql/query-syntax/value-exp#window-function-calls) for detailed syntax.

<Note>
Currently, `SESSION` frame is only supported in batch mode and emit-on-window-close streaming mode.
</Note>

When using session windows, you can achieve the effect that is very similar to `tumble()` and `hop()` time window functions, that is, to assign each row a time window by augmenting it with `window_start` and `window_end`. 

![Session time window](/images/session_time_window.png)

Given the following table data:

```bash
 user_id | product_id | viewed_at
---------+------------+---------------------
 1       | 1001       | 2022-07-01 22:00:00
 1       | 1002       | 2022-07-01 22:01:00
 1       | 1001       | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 1       | 1003       | 2022-07-01 22:10:00
 2       | 1003       | 2022-07-01 22:05:00
 2       | 1006       | 2022-07-01 22:05:30
```

And the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    user_id, product_id, viewed_at,
    first_value(viewed_at) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY viewed_at
        SESSION WITH GAP INTERVAL '5 MINUTES'
    ) AS window_start,
    last_value(viewed_at) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY viewed_at
        SESSION WITH GAP INTERVAL '5 MINUTES'
    ) AS window_end
FROM user_views
```

The result looks like this:

```bash
 user_id | product_id | viewed_at           | window_start        | window_end
---------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 1       | 1001       | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 1       | 1002       | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 1       | 1001       | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00
 1       | 1003       | 2022-07-01 22:10:00 | 2022-07-01 22:10:00 | 2022-07-01 22:10:00
 2       | 1003       | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:30
 2       | 1006       | 2022-07-01 22:05:30 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:30
```

## Window aggregations

Letâ€™s see how we can perform time window aggregations.

### Tumble window aggregations

Below is an example of tumble window aggregation. In this example, we want to get the number of trips and the total distance for each tumbling window (2 minutes).

```sql
SELECT window_start, window_end, count(trip_id) AS no_of_trips, sum(distance) AS total_distance
FROM TUMBLE (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '2 MINUTES')
GROUP BY window_start, window_end
ORDER BY window_start;
```

The result looks like this:

```bash
 window_start        | window_end          | no_of_trips | total_distance
---------------------+---------------------+-------------+----------------
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2           | 10
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2           | 10
 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 1           | 2
 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00 | 1           | 8
```

### Hop window aggregations

Below is an example of hopping window aggregation. In this example, we want to get the number of trips and the total distance within a two-minute window every minute.

```sql
SELECT window_start, window_end, count(trip_id) AS no_of_trips, sum(distance) AS total_distance
FROM HOP (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '1 MINUTES', INTERVAL '2 MINUTES')
GROUP BY window_start, window_end
ORDER BY window_start;
```

The result looks like this:

```bash
 window_start        | window_end          | no_of_trips | total_distance
---------------------+---------------------+-------------+----------------
 2022-07-01 21:59:00 | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 1           | 4
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2           | 10
 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2           | 9
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2           | 10
 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 1           | 7
 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 1           | 2
 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2022-07-01 22:07:00 | 2           | 10
 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00 | 1           | 8
```

### Session window aggregations
Below is an example of aggregation over session windows. In this example, we want to get the number of unique products viewed by each user in session gapped by 5 minutes interval, based on the example data in previous [Session windows](#session-windows) section.

```sql
SELECT
    user_id, window_start,
    count(DISTINCT product_id) AS n_viewed_product
FROM (
    SELECT
        *,
        first_value(viewed_at) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY viewed_at
            SESSION WITH GAP INTERVAL '5 MINUTES'
        ) AS window_start
    FROM user_views
)
GROUP BY user_id, window_start
ORDER BY user_id, window_start;
```

The result looks like this:

```bash
 user_id | window_start        | n_viewed_product
---------+---------------------+-----------------
 1       | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2
 1       | 2022-07-01 22:10:00 | 1
 2       | 2022-07-01 22:05:00 | 2
```

## Window joins

You can join a time window with a table, or another time window that is of the same type and has the same time attributes.

### Joins with tables

Let's see how you can join a time window with a table.

Suppose that you have a simple table `taxi_simple` that has the following data:

```bash
 taxi_id | company
---------+------------
 1001    | SAFE TAXI
 1002    | SUPER TAXI
 1003    | FAST TAXI
 1004    | BEST TAXI
 1005    | WEST TAXI
 1006    | EAST TAXI
```

You can join it with a time window:

```sql
SELECT trip.window_start, trip.window_end, trip.distance, taxi_simple.company
FROM TUMBLE (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '2 MINUTES') AS trip
JOIN taxi_simple
ON trip.taxi_id = taxi_simple.taxi_id
ORDER BY trip.window_start;
```

The result looks like this:

```sql
 window_start        | window_end          | distance | company
---------------------+---------------------+----------+------------
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 6        | SAFE TAXI
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 4        | SUPER TAXI
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 3        | FAST TAXI
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 7        | BEST TAXI
 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2        | WEST TAXI
 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00 | 8        | EAST TAXI
```

### Window joins

You can join two tumble time windows to get both trip and fare information. The corresponding tables are `taxi_trips` and `taxi_fare`.

The `taxi_fare` table has the following data:

```sql
 trip_id | completed_at        | total_fare | payment_status
---------+---------------------+------------+----------------
 1       | 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 8          | COMPLETED
 2       | 2022-07-01 22:01:00 | 12         | PROCESSING
 3       | 2022-07-01 22:02:10 | 5          | COMPLETED
 4       | 2022-07-01 22:03:00 | 15         | COMPLETED
 5       | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 5          | REJECTED
 6       | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 20         | COMPLETED
```

You can join two time windows:

```sql
SELECT trip.window_start, trip.window_end, trip.distance, fare.total_fare, fare.payment_status
FROM TUMBLE (taxi_trips, completed_at, INTERVAL '2 MINUTES') AS trip
JOIN TUMBLE (taxi_fare, completed_at, INTERVAL '2 MINUTES') AS fare
ON trip.trip_id = fare.trip_id AND trip.window_start = fare.window_start
ORDER BY trip.window_start;
```

The result looks like this.

```bash
 window_start        | window_end          | distance | total_fare | payment_status
---------------------+---------------------+----------+------------+----------------
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 4        | 8          | COMPLETED
 2022-07-01 22:00:00 | 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 6        | 12         | PROCESSING
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 7        | 15         | COMPLETED
 2022-07-01 22:02:00 | 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 3        | 5          | COMPLETED
 2022-07-01 22:04:00 | 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2        | 5          | REJECTED
 2022-07-01 22:06:00 | 2022-07-01 22:08:00 | 8        | 20         | COMPLETED
```
