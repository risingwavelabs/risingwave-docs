description: "A JOIN clause, also known as a join, combines the results of two or more table expressions based on certain conditions, such as whether the values of some columns are equal."
---

For regular equality joins on streaming queries, the temporary join results are unbounded. If the size of the join results becomes too large, query performance may get impacted. Therefore, you may want to consider time-bounded join types such as interval joins and temporal joins.

## Regular joins

RisingWave supports these regular join types:

* Inner joins
* Left (outer) joins
* Right (outer) joins
* Full (outer) joins

### Inner joins

An inner Join returns the rows from both the left and the right table expressions where the specified join condition is met. Rows that do not meet the condition will be excluded from the result set.

The syntax of INNER JOIN is as follows:

```sql
<table_expression> INNER JOIN <table_expression> ON <join_conditions>;
<table_expression> INNER JOIN <table_expression> USING (<col_name>, <col_name>, ...);
<table_expression> NATURAL [ INNER ] JOIN <table_expression>;
```

By default, filters that are not part of the join condition are evaluated after the inner join in streaming queries. This reduces extra computation but may hurt performance in some cases. To force filters to be pushed into the join operator in streaming mode, you can enable the following session variable `SET streaming_force_filter_inside_join = true`.

```sql Example
-- Define two tables
CREATE TABLE t(v1 INT, v2 INT);
CREATE TABLE t2(v3 INT, v4 INT);

-- Run a join query with a filter
SELECT * FROM t, t2 WHERE t.v1 = t2.v3 AND t.v2 > t2.v4 + 1000;
```

With this setting enabled, the filter `t.v2 > t2.v4 + 1000` is evaluated within the join rather than afterward.

### Left outer joins

A left outer join (or simply left join) returns all rows from the left table expression and the matched rows from the right table expression. If no match is found, NULL values will be filled in for columns from the right table.

The syntax of LEFT (OUTER) JOIN is as follows:

```sql
<table_expression> LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> ON <join_conditions>;
<table_expression> LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> USING (<col_name>, <col_name>, ...);
<table_expression> NATURAL LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression>;
```

### Right outer joins

A right outer join (or simply right join) returns all rows from the right table expression and the matched rows from the left table expression. If no match is found, NULL values will be returned for columns from the left table expression.

The syntax of RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN is as follows:

```sql
<table_expression> RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> ON <join_conditions>;
<table_expression> RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> USING (<col_name>, <col_name>, ...);
<table_expression> NATURAL RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression>;
```

### Full outer joins

A full outer join (or simply, full join) returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table expression. If no match is found, NULL values will be returned for columns from the table expression where no match is found.

```sql
<table_expression> FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> ON <join_conditions>;
<table_expression> FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression> USING (<col_name>, <col_name>, ...);
<table_expression> NATURAL FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN <table_expression>;
```

## ASOF joins

<Note>
ASOF join is supported for streaming queries since v2.1 and batch queries since v2.3.
</Note>

An ASOF join returns the nearest record in a reference table based on the event time or any ordered properties.

RisingWave supports the following ASOF join types for both streaming and batch queries. Be aware that for batch queries, when multiple rows in the right table qualify as the nearest match in an ASOF JOIN (i.e., they share the same ordered property, such as timestamp), the result may vary across executions.

- Inner ASOF join matches records only when both tables have corresponding data. Here's the syntax of an inner ASOF join:

  ```sql
  SELECT A.field1 AS A_field1 
  FROM TableA ASOF JOIN TableB 
  ON A.field1 = B.field1 AND A.field2 <= B.field2;
  ```

- Outer ASOF join includes all records from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table. When there is no match in the right table, the columns from the right table will have NULL values. Here's the syntax of an outer ASOF join:
  ```sql
  SELECT A.field1 AS A_field1 
  FROM TableA ASOF LEFT JOIN TableB 
  ON A.field1 = B.field1 AND A.field2 <= B.field2;
  ```
In both types of ASOF joins, the join condition must include at least one equality condition (`=`) and one inequality condition (`>=`, `>`, `<=`, or `<`). The inequality condition applies to all data types that support inequality comparison while a time-related type is commonly used.

For example, suppose you have two tables:

- `stock_prices`: Contains stock price data at certain timestamps.
  | stock_name | stock_time            | price |
  |:-----------|:----------------------|:------|
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 250   |
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 252   |
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 255   |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 3300  |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 3310  |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 3320  |
  | GOOG       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 1400  |
  | GOOG       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 1410  |
  | GOOG       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 1420  |

- `market_data`: Contains market sentiment data at different timestamps.
  | stock_name | market_time           | sentiment |
  |:-----------|:----------------------|:----------|
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 09:00:00   | 0.7       |
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 10:00:00   | 0.8       |
  | TSLA       | 2024-09-24 11:00:00   | 0.9       |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 09:00:00   | 0.6       |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 10:00:00   | 0.65      |
  | AMZN       | 2024-09-24 11:00:00   | 0.7       |
  | NVDA       | 2024-09-24 09:00:00   | 0.55      |
  | NVDA       | 2024-09-24 10:00:00   | 0.6       |
  | NVDA       | 2024-09-24 11:00:00   | 0.65      |

We want to join the stock prices with the nearest preceding market sentiment for each stock price based on time. We can use an ASOF JOIN to find the latest matching record in `market_data` where the `market_time` is less than or equal to the `stock_time`:

```sql
SELECT sp.stock_name, sp.stock_time, sp.price, md.sentiment
FROM stock_prices sp
ASOF JOIN market_data md 
ON sp.stock_name = md.stock_name 
AND md.market_time <= sp.stock_time;
```

Output:

| stock_name | stock_time            | price | sentiment |
|:-----------|:----------------------|:------|:----------|
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 250   | 0.7       |
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 252   | 0.8       |
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 255   | 0.9       |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 3300  | 0.6       |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 3310  | 0.65      |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 3320  | 0.7       |

We can use an ASOF LEFT JOIN to output records in the left table that have no matches in the right table.

```sql
SELECT sp.stock_name, sp.stock_time, sp.price, md.sentiment
FROM stock_prices sp
ASOF LEFT JOIN market_data md 
ON sp.stock_name = md.stock_name 
AND md.market_time <= sp.stock_time;
```
Output:
| stock_name | stock_time            | price | sentiment |
| :----------| :---------------------|:------|:----------|
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 250   | 0.7       |
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 252   | 0.8       |
| TSLA       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 255   | 0.9       |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 3300  | 0.6       |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 3310  | 0.65      |
| AMZN       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 3320  | 0.7       |
| GOOG       | 2024-09-24 09:30:00   | 1400  | NULL      |
| GOOG       | 2024-09-24 10:30:00   | 1410  | NULL      |
| GOOG       | 2024-09-24 11:30:00   | 1420  | NULL      |

TSLA and AMZN have matching records in `market_data`, so they show the closest preceding sentiment.
GOOG has no corresponding data in `market_data`, so the sentiment column is NULL.

## Windows joins

In a regular join (that is, a join without time attributes), the join state may grow without restriction. If you only need to get windowed results of two sources, you can segment data in the sources into time windows, and join matching windows from the two sources. To create a window join, the same time window functions must be used, and the window size must be the same.

The syntax of a window join is:

```sql
<time_window_expression> JOIN <time_window_expression> ON <join_conditions>;
```

One of the `join_conditions` must be an equality condition based on the watermarks of the two table expressions. For the syntax of `<time_window_expression>`, see [Time window functions](/processing/sql/time-windows).

For example, suppose you have these two sources:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE s1 (
 id int,
 value int,
 ts TIMESTAMP,
 WATERMARK FOR ts AS ts - INTERVAL '20' SECOND
) WITH (connector = 'datagen');

CREATE SOURCE s2 (
 id int,
 value int,
 ts TIMESTAMP,
 WATERMARK FOR ts AS ts - INTERVAL '20' SECOND
) WITH (connector = 'datagen');
```

You can join them with the following statement:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW window_join AS
SELECT s1.id AS id1,
       s1.value AS value1,
       s2.id AS id2,
       s2.value AS value2
FROM TUMBLE(s1, ts, interval '1' MINUTE)
JOIN TUMBLE(s2, ts, interval '1' MINUTE)
ON s1.id = s2.id and s1.window_start = s2.window_start;
```

## Interval joins

Window joins require that the two sources have the same window type and window size. This requirement can be too strict in some scenarios. If you want to join two sources that have some time offset, you can create an interval join by specifying an accepted interval range based on watermarks.

The syntax of an interval join is:

```sql
<table_expression> JOIN <table_expression> ON <equality_join_condition> AND <interval_condition> ...;
```

In an interval join, the `interval_condition` must be a watermark-based range.

For example, for sources `s1` and `s2` used in the above section, you can create an interval join:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW interval_join AS
SELECT s1.id AS id1,
       s1.value AS value1,
       s2.id AS id2,
       s2.value AS value2
FROM s1 JOIN s2
ON s1.id = s2.id and s1.ts between s2.ts and s2.ts + INTERVAL '1' MINUTE;
```

<Note>
Interval join‘s state cleaning is triggered only when upstream messages arrive, and it operates at the granularity of each join key. As a result, if no messages are received for a join key, the state may still hold stale data.

</Note>

## Process-time temporal joins

Process-time temporal joins are divided into two categories: append-only process-time temporal join and non-append-only process-time temporal join. Check the following instructions for their differences.

### Append-only process-time temporal join

An append-only temporal join is often used to widen a fact table. Its advantage is that it does not require RisingWave to maintain the join state, making it suitable for scenarios where the dimension table is not updated, or where updates to the dimension table do not affect the previously joined results. To further improve performance, you can use the index of a dimension table to form a join with the fact table.

```sql Syntax
SELECT ... FROM <table_expression> [AS <alias>]
[ LEFT | INNER ] JOIN <table_expression> FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME() [AS <alias>]
ON <join_conditions>;
```

<Note>
- The left table expression is an append-only table or source.
- The right table expression is a table, index or materialized view.
- The process-time syntax `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME()` is included in the right table expression.
- The join type is INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.
- The Join condition includes the primary key of the right table expression.

</Note>

For example, if you have an append-only stream that includes messages like below:

| transaction\_id | product\_id | quantity | sale\_date | process\_time       |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| 1               | 101         | 3        | 2023-06-18 | 2023-06-18 10:15:00 |
| 2               | 102         | 2        | 2023-06-19 | 2023-06-19 15:30:00 |
| 3               | 101         | 1        | 2023-06-20 | 2023-06-20 11:45:00 |

And a versioned table `products`:

| id  | product\_name | price | valid\_from         | valid\_to           |
| :-- | :------------ | :---- | :------------------ | :------------------ |
| 101 | Product A     | 20    | 2023-06-01 00:00:00 | 2023-06-15 23:59:59 |
| 101 | Product A     | 25    | 2023-06-16 00:00:00 | 2023-06-19 23:59:59 |
| 101 | Product A     | 22    | 2023-06-20 00:00:00 | NULL                |
| 102 | Product B     | 15    | 2023-06-01 00:00:00 | NULL                |

For the same product ID, the product name or the price is updated from time to time.

You can use a temporal join to fetch the latest product name and price from the `products` table and form a wider table. To further improve performance, you can create an index for table `products`, and join `sales` with the index instead.

```sql
SELECT transaction_id, product_id, quantity, sale_date, product_name, price
FROM sales
JOIN products FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME()
ON product_id = id WHERE process_time BETWEEN valid_from AND valid_to;
```

| transaction\_id | product\_id | quantity | sale\_date | product\_name | price |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :------- | :--------- | :------------ | :---- |
| 1               | 101         | 3        | 2023-06-18 | Product A     | 25    |
| 2               | 102         | 2        | 2023-06-19 | Product B     | 15    |
| 3               | 101         | 1        | 2023-06-20 | Product A     | 22    |

### Non-append-only process-time temporal join

Compared to the append-only temporal join, the non-append-only temporal join can accommodate non-append-only input for the left table. However, it introduces an internal state to materialize the lookup result for each left-hand side (LHS) insertion. This allows the temporal join operator to retract the join result it sends downstream when update or delete messages arrive.

The non-append-only temporal join shares the same syntax as the append-only temporal join.

```sql Syntax
<table_expression> [ LEFT | INNER ] JOIN <table_expression> FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME() ON <join_conditions>;
```

For example, if you update the table `sales`:

```sql
UPDATE sales SET quantity = quantity + 1;
```

You will get these results:

| transaction\_id | product\_id | quantity | sale\_date | product\_name | price |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :------- | :--------- | :------------ | :---- |
| 1               | 101         | 4        | 2023-06-18 | Product A     | 25    |
| 2               | 102         | 3        | 2023-06-19 | Product B     | 15    |
| 3               | 101         | 2        | 2023-06-20 | Product A     | 22    |

<Note>
Every time you update the left-hand side table, it will look up the latest data from the right-hand side table.
</Note>

## Optimizations

### Converting dimension table joins to process time joins

The `JOIN` operator is used to join two streams of data together. It can be used to join two streams of data that are both being ingested in real-time.
Whenever there's some updates on one side of the join, it will look for matches on the other side of the join.

Consider a fact and dimension table join:
```sql
select fact.* FROM fact JOIN dimension ON fact.dim_key = dimension.key;
```
If the fact table only needs to look up the dimension table at the time of the join, this approach will be inefficient. This is because any updates to the dimension table will trigger a lookup on the fact side and recompute the join result for all matching fact rows, even if they are stale.

Instead, you can use a `PROCESS TIME JOIN`, which will only look up the dimension table at the time of the join.
This will be more efficient, as whenever there's dimension table update,
it will not recompute the join result for all matching fact side rows.
```sql
select fact.* FROM fact JOIN dimension FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME() ON fact.dim_key = dimension.key;
```

### Isolating high-amplification joins

<Note>
Added in v2.5.0.
</Note>

High join amplification in streaming queries can cause significant backpressure on downstream operators. To mitigate this, you can enable unaligned joins using:

```sql
SET streaming_enable_unaligned_join = true;

-- Streaming jobs in the same session will use unaligned join for all their joins.
-- For instance given:
create table t1 (v1 int, v2 int);
create table t2 (v3 int, v4 int);
create table t3 (v5 int, v6 int);
explain create materialized view m1 as select * from t1, t2, t3 where t1.v1 = t2.v3 and t1.v1 = t3.v5;

-- You can see the `explain` output contains `SyncLogStore` after the joins.
    StreamMaterialize { columns: [v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, t1._row_id(hidden), t2._row_id(hidden), t3._row_id(hidden)], stream_key: [t1._row_id, t2._row_id, v1, t3._row_id], pk_columns: [t1._row_id, t2._row_id, v1, t3._row_id], pk_conflict: NoCheck }
    └─StreamSyncLogStore
      └─StreamHashJoin { type: Inner, predicate: t1.v1 = t3.v5, output: [t1.v1, t1.v2, t2.v3, t2.v4, t3.v5, t3.v6, t1._row_id, t2._row_id, t3._row_id] }
        ├─StreamSyncLogStore
        │ └─StreamHashJoin { type: Inner, predicate: t1.v1 = t2.v3, output: [t1.v1, t1.v2, t2.v3, t2.v4, t1._row_id, t2._row_id] }
        │   ├─StreamExchange { dist: HashShard(t1.v1) }
        │   │ └─StreamTableScan { table: t1, columns: [t1.v1, t1.v2, t1._row_id], stream_scan_type: ArrangementBackfill, stream_key: [t1._row_id], pk: [_row_id], dist: UpstreamHashShard(t1._row_id) }
        │   └─StreamExchange { dist: HashShard(t2.v3) }
        │     └─StreamTableScan { table: t2, columns: [t2.v3, t2.v4, t2._row_id], stream_scan_type: ArrangementBackfill, stream_key: [t2._row_id], pk: [_row_id], dist: UpstreamHashShard(t2._row_id) }
        └─StreamExchange { dist: HashShard(t3.v5) }
          └─StreamTableScan { table: t3, columns: [t3.v5, t3.v6, t3._row_id], stream_scan_type: ArrangementBackfill, stream_key: [t3._row_id], pk: [_row_id], dist: UpstreamHashShard(t3._row_id) }
```

This optimization automatically places a buffer after the join operator. The join writes its output to this buffer, allowing checkpoint barriers to pass through immediately instead of waiting for a slow downstream operator to process the data. This approach is most effective when downstream is the processing bottleneck.

<Note>
- There is currently no way to disable the log store in-place.
- This optimization introduces a trade-off: improved pipeline stability at the cost of increased end-to-end latency due to the buffering step. Monitoring for potential data lag in the buffer is recommended.
- High join amplification means a large number of rows are produced from the join. While this approach mitigates barrier latency, we still need to scale the cluster to provide more resources for processing the large amount of rows.
</Note>
