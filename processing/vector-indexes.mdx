RisingWave supports vector indexes to enable efficient similarity search operations. Vector indexes are specialized data structures that optimize queries involving vector distance calculations.

## Creating vector indexes

Use the `CREATE INDEX` command with vector-specific syntax to create vector indexes. For more details, see [CREATE INDEX](/sql/commands/sql-create-index).

```sql Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name 
USING { FLAT | HNSW } (vector_column | expression) 
[ INCLUDE ( include_column [, ...] ) ]
[ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ];
```

## Index types

Before creating a vector index, you may create a sample table `item` to reference the table name and column names. Currently, we only support creating vector indexes on append-only inputs, such as append-only tables or materialized views. Therefore, we have to specify the table as append-only here:

```sql
create table items (id int primary key, name string, embedding vector(128)) append only;
```

RisingWave supports two methods when creating index:

- FLAT index: Provides exact results by comparing the query vector against all stored vectors.

    ```sql
    -- Create a FLAT vector index
    CREATE INDEX idx_embedding ON items 
    USING FLAT (embedding) 
    INCLUDE (name) 
    WITH (distance_type = 'l2');
    ```

- HNSW index: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index that provides approximate nearest neighbor search with better performance for large datasets.


    ```sql
    -- Create an HNSW vector index
    CREATE INDEX idx_embedding_hnsw ON items 
    USING HNSW (embedding) 
    INCLUDE (name) 
    WITH (
        distance_type = 'inner_product', 
        m = 32, 
        ef_construction = 40, 
        max_level = 5
    );
    ```

For HNSW index, we also support specifying a query parameter `ef_search` by setting the session variable `batch_hnsw_ef_search` (the default value is 40).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Valid for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `distance_type` | Distance metric to use: `l2`, `cosine`, `l1`, or `inner_product` | FLAT, HNSW |
| `m` | Optional. Maximum number of connections per node | HNSW |
| `ef_construction` | Optional. Size of dynamic candidate list during construction | HNSW |
| `max_level` | Optional. Maximum level of the HNSW graph | HNSW |

## Vector distance operators

RisingWave provides specialized operators for calculating vector distances:

| Operator | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<->` | `l2_distance()` | Euclidean (L2) distance |
| `<=>` | `cosine_distance()` | Cosine distance |
| `<+>` | `l1_distance()` | Manhattan (L1) distance |
| `<#>` | Negative inner product | Negative inner product distance |

## Vector similarity search

Use vector distance operators with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to perform similarity search:

```sql
-- Find the 5 most similar items using L2 distance
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' 
LIMIT 5;

-- Find similar items using cosine distance
SELECT id, name FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]' 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Vector indexes on function expressions

You can create vector indexes on function expressions instead of raw columns. This allows you to avoid storing a separate vector column, saving storage and reducing maintenance costs.

1. Create the table to include the input column

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    description STRING
    -- embedding column is optional if using function expression
);
```

The `embedding` column is used to store the embedding generated from the `description` column. If you create the vector index directly from `description` column with function expression, you don't have to store raw `embedding` in the table.

2. Define the user-defined function (UDF)

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_embedding(string) RETURNS VECTOR(128) LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
SELECT openai_embedding('{"model": <EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME>, "api_key": <API_KEY>}'::jsonb, $1)::vector(128);
$$;
```

3. Create the vector index on the function expression

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_embedding_func ON items
USING FLAT (get_embedding(description))
INCLUDE(description)
WITH (distance_type = 'l2');
```

In this example, `get_embedding(description)` is used as the index expression.

This approach avoids materializing a separate vector column in the table, which reduces storage costs and keeps the table schema simpler.

## Streaming vector index lookup

<Note>
Added in v2.7.0.
</Note>

After creating a vector index, you can use array subqueries to define streaming jobs that look up the vector index, and expand the input with an additional array column containing the Top-N nearest rows.

The query syntax is as follows:

```sql Syntax
SELECT 
    <input_table_col1>, 
    <input_table_col2>, 
    ..., 
    array(
        SELECT row(<col1>, <col2>, .., <col_n>)
        FROM <indexed_table> FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME()
        ORDER BY <input_embedding_col> <=> <indexed_table_embedding_col>
        LIMIT N
    ) AS top_n_related
FROM <input>;
```

This query expands the input with an extra column. The data type of the expanded column is:

```sql
struct<col1, col2, ..., col_n>[]
```

You can use this query to create a **materialized view**, **sink**, or **sink into table**, thereby defining a streaming job that performs vector index lookups. When creating such streaming jobs, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` must be set to `PROCTIME()`. See [example](/processing/vector-indexes#vector-index-lookup-in-streaming-sinks).

The same syntax is also supported in **ad-hoc queries**. In that case, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` is optional, and you may specify a different system time, similar to how [time travel queries](/processing/time-travel-queries) are defined.

<Info>
- Currently, vector index lookups are supported only for append-only inputs.
- All columns returned by the lookup from the indexed table must be included in the vector index.

## Examples

### Basic vector similarity search

```sql
-- Create table with vector data
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING,
    description STRING,
    embedding vector(128)
) APPEND ONLY;

-- Create vector index
CREATE INDEX idx_embedding ON products
USING HNSW (embedding)
WITH (distance_type = 'cosine');

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO products (id, name, description, embedding) VALUES
(1, 'Product A', 'Description for Product A', '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'),
(2, 'Product B', 'Description for Product B', '[0.3, 0.4, ...]');

-- Find similar products
SELECT id, name
FROM products
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.2, 0.3, ...]'
LIMIT 5;
```

### Using cosine distance type

The SQL query depends on the type of vector index you created:

- If the vector index is built on a raw embedding column, use the raw column in your `ORDER BY` clause.

```sql
-- Query on the raw embedding column
SELECT * FROM items
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.5, 0.5, 0.0]' 
LIMIT 3;
```

- If the vector index is built using a function expression, use the same function expression in your `ORDER BY` clause.

```sql
-- Query on a function expression
SELECT * FROM items
ORDER BY get_embedding(description) <=> '[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]'
LIMIT 3;
```

### Vector index lookup in streaming sinks

Suppose you have two append-only tables, `items` and `events`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    text STRING,
    embedding VECTOR(3)
) APPEND ONLY;

CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    time TIMESTAMP,
    embedding VECTOR(3)
);
```

Create a vector index on the `items` table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX raw_column_index
ON items USING HNSW (embedding)
WITH (distance_type = 'l2');
```

You can then create a sink to table or external system that uses the embedding from the `events` table to look up the vector index on `items`:

```sql
CREATE SINK AS
SELECT
    event_id,
    array(
        SELECT row(text)
        FROM items FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF PROCTIME()
        ORDER BY events.embedding <-> items.embedding
        LIMIT 3
    ) AS related_info,
    time
FROM events
WITH (...);
```

For each row in `events`, this query expands the output with a new column. The row `embedding` in `events` is used to query the vector index, retrieve a list of the Top-N nearest `text` values, and store the result in an array column. With these Top-N nearest `text`s, the related content can be further processed for downstream scenarios such as real-time RAG.
