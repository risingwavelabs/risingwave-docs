RisingWave supports vector indexes to enable efficient similarity search operations. Vector indexes are specialized data structures that optimize queries involving vector distance calculations.

## Creating vector indexes

Use the `CREATE INDEX` command with vector-specific syntax to create vector indexes. For more details, see [CREATE INDEX](/sql/commands/sql-create-index).

```sql Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name 
USING { FLAT | HNSW } (vector_column | expression) 
[ INCLUDE ( include_column [, ...] ) ]
[ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ];
```

## Index types

RisingWave supports two methods when creating index:

- FLAT index: Provides exact results by comparing the query vector against all stored vectors.

    ```sql
    -- Create a FLAT vector index
    CREATE INDEX idx_embedding ON items 
    USING FLAT (embedding) 
    INCLUDE (name) 
    WITH (distance_type = 'l2');
    ```

- HNSW index: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index that provides approximate nearest neighbor search with better performance for large datasets.


    ```sql
    -- Create an HNSW vector index
    CREATE INDEX idx_embedding_hnsw ON items 
    USING HNSW (embedding) 
    INCLUDE (name) 
    WITH (
        distance_type = 'inner_product', 
        m = 32, 
        ef_construction = 40, 
        max_level = 5
    );
    ```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Valid for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `distance_type` | Distance metric to use: `l2`, `cosine`, `l1`, or `inner_product` | FLAT, HNSW |
| `m` | Maximum number of connections per node | HNSW |
| `ef_construction` | Size of dynamic candidate list during construction | HNSW |
| `max_level` | Maximum level of the HNSW graph | HNSW |

## Vector distance operators

RisingWave provides specialized operators for calculating vector distances:

| Operator | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<->` | `l2_distance()` | Euclidean (L2) distance |
| `<=>` | `cosine_distance()` | Cosine distance |
| `<+>` | `l1_distance()` | Manhattan (L1) distance |
| `<#>` | Negative inner product | Negative inner product distance |

## Vector similarity search

Use vector distance operators with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to perform similarity search:

```sql
-- Find the 5 most similar items using L2 distance
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' 
LIMIT 5;

-- Find similar items using cosine distance
SELECT id, name FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]' 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Vector data type, operators, functions

RisingWave provides a `vector(n)` data type where `n` specifies the dimension of the vector.

```sql
-- Create a table with vector columns
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING,
    embedding vector(3)
) APPEND ONLY;
```

RisingWave also provides various operators and functions for working with vectors. See [Vector data type](/sql/data-types/vector) for details.

## Vector indexes on function expressions

You can create vector indexes on function expressions:

```sql
-- Create index on a function expression
CREATE INDEX idx_embedding_func ON items 
USING FLAT (get_embedding(text)) 
INCLUDE(text) 
WITH (distance_type = 'l2');
```

## Examples

### Basic vector similarity search

```sql
-- Create table with vector data
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING,
    features vector(128)
) APPEND ONLY;

-- Create vector index
CREATE INDEX idx_features ON products 
USING HNSW (features) 
WITH (distance_type = 'cosine');

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO products VALUES 
(1, 'Product A', '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'),
(2, 'Product B', '[0.3, 0.4, ...]');

-- Find similar products
SELECT id, name 
FROM products 
ORDER BY features <=> '[0.2, 0.3, ...]' 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Using different distance metrics

```sql
-- L2 distance for geometric similarity
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]' 
LIMIT 3;

-- Cosine distance for normalized similarity
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.5, 0.5, 0.0]' 
LIMIT 3;

-- Inner product for dot product similarity
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY embedding <#> '[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]' 
LIMIT 3;
```
