  - Supports `SET SCHEMA` syntax for `ALTER {TABLE t | [MATERIALIZED] VIEW (m)v | SOURCE src | SINK sink | CONNECTION c | FUNCTION f( argument_type [, ...] )}`. [#13341](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13341). See [SQL commands](/docs/1.5/sql-commands/).
  - Supports `OWNER TO` syntax for ALTER {`DATABASE | SCHEMA | TABLE | [MATERIALIZED] VIEW | SOURCE | SINK`}. [#13216](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13216). See [SQL commands](/docs/1.5/sql-commands/).
  - Supports `RENAME TO` syntax for `ALTER { DATABASE db | SCHEMA s}`. [#13713](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13713). See [SQL commands](/docs/1.5/sql-commands/).

## v1.1.0

This version was released on August 8, 2023.

### Main changes

#### SQL features

- SQL commands:

  - `DROP` commands now support the `CASCADE` option, which drops the specified item and all its dependencies. [#11250](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11250)

  - `CREATE TABLE` now supports the `APPEND ONLY` clause, allowing the definition of watermark columns on the table. [#11233](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11233)

  - Supports new commands `START TRANSACTION`, `BEGIN`, and `COMMIT` for read-only transactions. [#10735](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10735)

  - Supports `SHOW CLUSTER` to show the details of your RisingWave cluster, including the address of the cluster, its state, the parallel units it is using, and whether it's streaming data, serving data, or unschedulable. [#10656](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10656), [#10932](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10932)

- SQL functions:

  - Supports new window functions: `lead()` and `lag()`. [#10915](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10915)

  - Supports new aggregate functions: `first_value()` and `last_value()`, which retrieve the first and last values within a specific ordering from a set of rows. [#10740](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10740)

  - Supports the `grouping()` function to determine if a column or expression in the `GROUP BY` clause is part of the current grouping set or not. [#11006](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11006)

  - Supports the `set_config()` system administration function. [#11147](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11147)

  - Supports the `sign()` mathematical function. [#10819](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10819)

  - Supports `string_agg()` with `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY`, enabling advanced string concatenation with distinct values and custom sorting. [#10864](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10864)

  - Supports the co-existence of `string_agg()` and other aggregations with `DISTINCT`. [#10864](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10864)

  - Supports the `zone_string` parameter in the `date_trunc()`, `extract()`, and `date_part()` functions, ensuring compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#10480](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10480)

    - **Breaking change**: Previously, when the input for `date_trunc` was actually a date, the function would cast it to a timestamp and record the choice in the query plan. However, after this release, new query plans will cast the input to `timestamptz` instead. As a result, some old SQL queries, especially those saved as views, may fail to bind correctly and require type adjustments. It's important to note that old query plans will continue working because the casting choice is recorded with a cast to timestamp.

        Before this release:

          ```sql
          SELECT date_trunc('month', date '2023-03-04');

                  date_trunc
          ---------------------------
            2023-03-01 00:00:00
          (1 row)
          ```

        After this release:

          ```sql
          SELECT date_trunc('month', date '2023-03-04');

                  date_trunc
          ---------------------------
            2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00
          (1 row)
          ```

        Now, the result of `date_trunc` includes the timezone offset (`+00:00`) in the output, making it consistent with the behavior in PostgreSQL.

  - `round()` now accepts a negative value and rounds it to the left of the decimal point. [#10961](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10961)

  - `to_timestamp()` now returns `timestamptz`. [#11018](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11018)

- Query clauses

  - `SELECT` now supports the `EXCEPT` clause which excludes specific columns from the result set. [#10438](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10438), [#10723](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10723)

  - `SELECT` now supports the `GROUPING SETS` clause which allows users to perform aggregations on multiple levels of grouping within a single query. [#10807](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10807)

  - Supports index selection for temporal joins. [#11019](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11019)

  - Supports `CUBE` in group-by clauses to generate multiple grouping sets. [#11262](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11262)

- Patterns
  - Supports multiple rank function calls in TopN by group. [#11149](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11149)

- System catalog

  - Supports querying `created_at` and `initialized_at` from RisingWave relations such as sources, sinks, and tables in RisingWave catalogs. [#11199](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11199)

#### Connectors

- Supports specifying more Kafka parameters when creating a source or sink. [#11203](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11203)

- JDBC sinks used for upserts must specify the downstream primary key via the `primary_key` option. [#11042](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11042)

- `access_key` and its corresponding `secret_key` are now mandatory for all AWS authentication components. [#11120](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11120)

[#10195](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10195)

    ```sql title="Old"
    CREATE TABLE debezium_non_compact (order_id int PRIMARY KEY) WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    kafka.topic = 'debezium_non_compact_avro_json',
    kafka.brokers = 'message_queue:29092',
    kafka.scan.startup.mode = 'earliest'
    ) ROW FORMAT DEBEZIUM_AVRO ROW SCHEMA LOCATION CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://message_queue:8081';
    ```

    ```sql title="New"
    CREATE TABLE debezium_non_compact (PRIMARY KEY(order_id)) WITH ( ...
    ```

- ***Breaking change***: Modifies the syntax for specifying data and encoding formats for a source in `CREATE SOURCE` and `CREATE TABLE` commands. For v1.0.0, the old syntax is still accepted but will be deprecated in the next release. [#10768](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10768)

    Old syntax - part 1:

    ```

    New syntax - part 1:

    ```sql
    FORMAT data_format ENCODE data_encode (
        message = 'message',
        schema.location = 'location' | schema.registry = 'schema_registry_url'
    );
    ```

    Old syntax - part 2:

    ```sql
    ROW FORMAT csv WITHOUT HEADER DELIMITED BY ',';
    ```

    New syntax - part 2:

    ```sql
    FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE CSV (
        without_header = 'true',
        delimiter = ','
    );
    ```

## v0.18.0

This version was released on March 31, 2023.

Starting from this version, we’ll respect semantic versioning conventions by using the middle number (`y` , instead of `z,` in `x.y.z`) to indicate minor versions. That is why this is `v0.18.0`, not `v0.1.18`.

## v0.1.11

This version was released on July 29, 2022.

### Main changes

#### SQL features

- New SQL functions:
  - `overlay()`: Replaces a substring. [#3671](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3671)
  - `generate_series()`: Generates a series of values from the starting point to the ending point. [#4030](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4030)
  - `regexp_match()`, `regexp_matches()`: Compares a string against a regular expression pattern and returns matched substrings. [#3702](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3702) [#4062](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4062)
  - `string_agg ()`: Concatenates the values into a string. [#3952](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3952) [#4183](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4183)
  - `current_database()`: Returns the current database.  [#3650](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3650)
- New SQL commands:
  - `SHOW ALL`: Lists all configuration parameters. Use `SHOW parameter` to show the value of a configuration parameter. [#3694](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3694) [#3664](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3664)
  - `CREATE SINK`: Sinks data to Kafka. [#3923](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3923) [#3682](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3682) [#3674](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3674)
  - `EXPLAIN TRACE`: Traces each optimization stage of the optimizer. [#3945](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3945)
- Support for lookup joins. Currently, lookup joins can only be performed in local query mode. To use lookup joins, users need to set the configuration parameter `rw_batch_enable_lookup_join`  to true.  [#3859](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3859) [#3763](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3763)
- An `ORDER BY` clause in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement is allowed but not considered as part of the definition of the materialized view. It is only used in the initial creation of the materialized view. It is not used during refreshes. This is a behavior change due to the introduction of parallel table scans. [#3670](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3670)
- Support for filter clauses on aggregate functions. [#4114](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4114)

#### Connectors

- RisingWave can now sink data to Kafka topics in append-only mode and Debezium mode. [#3923](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3923) [#3682](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3682) [#3674](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3674)
- Syntax change for `CREATE SOURCE`: A parameter name is no longer wrapped by single quotation marks. [#3997](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3997). See the example:
  - Old: `CREATE SOURCE s1 WITH ( 'connector' = 'kafka', 'kafka.topic' = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', 'kafka.brokers' = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`
  - New: `CREATE SOURCE s WITH ( connector = 'kafka', kafka.topic = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', kafka.brokers = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`
