title: "Ingest data from MongoDB CDC"
DESCRIPTION: "For ingesting CDC data from MongoDB to RisingWave, you can use the built-in `mongodb-cdc` connector to easily ingest data from MongoDB into RisingWave. Alternatively, you can use the [Debezium connector for MongoDB](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/mongodb) to convert change streams from MongoDB to Kafka topics and ingest these topics into RisingWave."
sidebarTitle: MongoDB CDC
---


This topic walks you through the steps to ingest change streams from MongoDB to RisingWave using the built-in connector.

## Notes about running RisingWave from binaries

If you are running RisingWave locally from binaries and intend to use the native CDC source connectors or the JDBC sink connector, make sure that you have [JDK 11](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/) or later versions installed in your environment.

## Create a table in RisingWave using the native CDC connector

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] source_name (
    _id data_type PRIMARY KEY ,
    payload jsonb
)
[ INCLUDE timestamp AS column_name ]
WITH (
    connector='mongodb-cdc',
    connector_parameter='value', ...
);

```

### Connector parameters

Unless specified otherwise, the fields listed are required. Note that the value of these parameters should be enclosed in single quotation marks.

| Field           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mongodb.url     | The [connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) of MongoDB.                                                                                                                                                          |
| collection.name | The collection or collections you want to ingest data from. Use the format db\_name.collection\_name to specify which database the collection is in. To ingest data from collections in different database, use a comma-separated list of regular expressions. |

Regarding the `INCLUDE timestamp AS column_name` clause, it allows you to ingest the upstream commit timestamp. For historical data, the commit timestamp will be set to `1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00`. Here is an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (_id JSONB PRIMARY KEY, payload JSONB)
INCLUDE timestamp AS commit_ts
WITH (
  connector = 'mongodb-cdc',
  mongodb.url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
  collection.name = 'test.*'
);

SELECT * FROM test;

----RESULT
                 _id                  |                                      payload                                      |         commit_ts
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------
 {"$oid": "664c48e87d2c84adfabfc03f"} | {"_id": {"$oid": "664c48e87d2c84adfabfc03f"}, "data": "mydata", "name": "Ada"} | 2024-05-21 08:18:25+00:00
 {"$oid": "660125a80f048c7c7eff4a6a"} | {"_id": {"$oid": "660125a80f048c7c7eff4a6a"}, "name": "Tom"}                       | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00

```

### Metadata options

| Field            | Notes                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------ |
| database\_name   | Name of the database.           |
| collection\_name | Name of the MongoDB collection. |

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (_id JSONB PRIMARY KEY, payload JSONB)
INCLUDE TIMESTAMP as commit_ts
INCLUDE DATABASE_NAME as database_name
INCLUDE COLLECTION_NAME as collection_name
WITH (
  connector = 'mongodb-cdc',
  mongodb.url = 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
  collection.name = 'random_data.*'
);
```

## Examples

The following SQL query creates a table that ingests data from all collections in the `dev` database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE source_name (
   _id varchar PRIMARY KEY,
   payload jsonb
) WITH (
   connector='mongodb-cdc',
   mongodb.url='mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
   collection.name='dev.*'
);
```

The following SQL query creates a table that ingests data from all collections in the databases `db1` and `db2`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE source_name (
   _id varchar PRIMARY KEY,
   payload jsonb
) WITH (
   connector='mongodb-cdc',
   mongodb.url='mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
   collection.name='db1.*, db2.*'
);
```
