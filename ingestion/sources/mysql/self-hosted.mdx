To use the MySQL CDC features, we need to create a MySQL user account with appropriate privileges on all databases for which RisingWave will read from.

## Create a user and grant privileges

1. Create a MySQL user with the following query.

```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

2. Grant the appropriate privileges to the user.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'user'@'%';
```

3. Finalize the privileges.

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Enable the binlog

The binlog must be enabled for MySQL replication. The binary logs record transaction updates for replication tools to propagate changes.

1. Check if the `log-bin` is already on.

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| log_bin       | OFF   |
+---------------+-------+
```

2. If it is `OFF`, configure your MySQL server configuration file, my.cnf, with the following properties described below. Restart your MySQL server to let the configurations take effect.

```sql
server-id         = 223344
log_bin           = mysql-bin
binlog_format     = ROW
binlog_row_image  = FULL
expire_logs_days  = 10
```

3. Confirm your changes by checking the `log-bin` again.

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| log_bin       | ON    |
+---------------+-------+
```
