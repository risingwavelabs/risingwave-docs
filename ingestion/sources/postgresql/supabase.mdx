[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) uses PostgreSQL as its underlying database, so you can connect to it using RisingWave's PostgreSQL CDC connector.

For an in-depth guide, see our blog post: [Unleash the true power of Supabase realtime with RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/unleash-the-true-power-of-supabase-realtime-with-risingwave/).

## 1. Enable replication in Supabase

In your Supabase project, navigate to **Database > Replication**. Ensure that replication is enabled for the tables you wish to stream to RisingWave. Supabase handles the underlying logical replication configuration for you when you enable this.

## 2. Get your database credentials

Find your project's database connection details in the Supabase dashboard under **Project Settings > Database**. You will need the host, port, user, and password.

## 3. Configure privileges

While Supabase manages the `REPLICATION` role, you still need to ensure your user has `SELECT` privileges on the tables you want to stream. Connect to your Supabase database and run:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON <table_name> TO <user_name>;
```
You might need to do this for each table.

## Next step

Now that your Supabase project is configured, you can proceed to connect RisingWave.
