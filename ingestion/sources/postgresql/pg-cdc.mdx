This guide explains how to connect RisingWave to a PostgreSQL database to ingest data changes in real time using the native PostgreSQL CDC source connector.

RisingWave's PostgreSQL CDC connector is compatible with any PostgreSQL-compliant database that supports logical replication, and supports **PostgreSQL versions 10 through 17**.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting to RisingWave, you must enable logical replication on your upstream database. The specific steps depend on your provider. Select your platform below for detailed setup instructions:

*   **[Set up a self-hosted PostgreSQL database](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/self-hosted)**
*   **[Set up AWS RDS or Aurora PostgreSQL](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/aws-rds)**
*   **[Set up a Neon serverless PostgreSQL database](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/neon)**
*   **[Set up a Supabase project](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/supabase)**

Once setup is complete, return to this guide to connect RisingWave.

## User permissions

Before connecting to PostgreSQL CDC, you need to set up proper user permissions. The PostgreSQL user used for CDC must have specific privileges to perform logical replication.

### Required user permissions

The replication user needs the following permissions:

* `REPLICATION` privilege
* `CONNECT` privilege on the target database
* `SELECT` privilege on the tables to be replicated
* Permission to create publications (if `publication.create.enable` is enabled)

### Publication permissions

If you don't make any special settings, RisingWave will automatically help you create publications. In this case, the user needs:

* **CREATE PUBLICATION permission**: The user must be the database owner, have SUPERUSER privileges, or have CREATE privileges on the database
* **ALTER PUBLICATION ADD TABLE permission**: The user must be the table owner or have SUPERUSER privileges

If you set `publication.create.enable = 'false'`, the user only needs SELECT privileges on the tables, and you must manually create the publication. This approach reduces permission requirements since you don't need to be the table owner.

### Setting up permissions

For basic user creation and privilege granting, see the setup instructions for your specific PostgreSQL deployment:

* **[Self-hosted PostgreSQL](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/self-hosted)**
* **[AWS RDS PostgreSQL](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/aws-rds)**
* **[Neon PostgreSQL](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/neon)**
* **[Supabase PostgreSQL](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/supabase)**

## Connect to PostgreSQL

RisingWave uses the `CREATE SOURCE` or `CREATE TABLE ... FROM source` syntax to connect to PostgreSQL CDC. You'll use `CREATE SOURCE` to create a shared source, and then create multiple tables from it, each representing a table in the upstream PostgreSQL database.

### `CREATE SOURCE`

Use the `CREATE SOURCE` statement to define the source with connection parameters.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] source_name WITH (
    connector='postgres-cdc',
    <field>=<value>, ...
);
```

### `CREATE TABLE ... FROM source` (per-table definition)

Create a table on top of the defined source. Note that a primary key is required and must be consistent with the upstream table. We must also specify the Postgres table name (`pg_table_name`) which we are selecting from.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (
    column_name data_type PRIMARY KEY , ...
    PRIMARY KEY ( column_name, ... )
)
[ INCLUDE timestamp AS column_name ]
WITH (
    snapshot='true'
)
FROM source TABLE pg_table_name;
```

### Basic connection example

```sql
-- Create a shared CDC source
CREATE SOURCE pg_source WITH (
    connector='postgres-cdc',
    hostname='localhost',
    port='5432',
    username='your_user',
    password='your_password',
    database.name='your_database',
    schema.name='public' -- Optional, defaults to 'public'
);

-- Create a table from the source, representing a specific PostgreSQL table
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR
)
FROM pg_source TABLE 'public.my_upstream_table';
```

## Configuration Parameters

This section contains a complete reference for all parameters used when creating a PostgreSQL CDC source.

### Debezium parameters

You can also specify any valid [Debezium PostgreSQL connector configuration property](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.6/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-advanced-configuration-properties) in the `WITH` clause. Prefix the Debezium parameter name with `debezium.`.

For example, to skip unknown DDL statements, use:

```sql
debezium.schema.history.internal.skip.unparseable.ddl = 'true'
```

## Features and reference

### Data format

The PostgreSQL CDC connector uses the Debezium JSON format for data.

### Supported data types

The following table shows the data type mapping from PostgreSQL to RisingWave.

<Note>
RisingWave does not support directly creating tables from PostgreSQL composite types. If you want to read composite type data, you will need to use a source and create a materialized view based off that source.

### Support for PostgreSQL TOAST

RisingWave supports [TOASTed (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) data](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) from PostgreSQL when using the CDC connector. This ensures that even columns with very large values, such as long text or large JSON objects, are ingested completely and accurately during both the initial backfill and incremental changes.

RisingWave can process changes to rows with TOASTed data even if the upstream table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` is set to `default`. RisingWave achieves this by leveraging its own materialized state of the source data. When an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` event occurs, RisingWave uses the record stored within its materialized view to construct the full change event, rather than relying on the `before` field in the CDC message.

The example below demonstrates how RisingWave ingests large data that triggers PostgreSQL's TOAST mechanism.

1. Create a table in PostgreSQL with large JSONB and TEXT columns and insert initial data.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE toast_test_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    large_jsonb JSONB,
    large_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
    );

    INSERT INTO toast_test_table (name, large_jsonb, large_text)
    SELECT
    'toast_record_' || s,
    jsonb_build_object(
        'id', s,
        'large_string', repeat('This is a very long string that will trigger TOAST. ', 80),
        'nested_object', jsonb_build_object('deep_content', repeat('Deep nested content. ', 40)),
        'metadata', jsonb_build_object('description', repeat('Extra metadata. ', 30))
    ),
    repeat('Large text field that also triggers TOAST. ', 60)
    FROM generate_series(1, 4) s;
    ```

2. Create a RisingWave source using PostgreSQL CDC.

    ```sql
    CREATE SOURCE toast_test_source WITH (
    connector = 'postgres-cdc',
    hostname = '${PGHOST:localhost}',
    port = '${PGPORT:8432}',
    username = '${PGUSER:$USER}',
    password = '${PGPASSWORD:123456}',
    database.name = '${PGDATABASE:mydb}',
    schema.name = 'public',
    slot.name = 'toast_test_slot'
    );
    ```

3. Create a RisingWave table from the source.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE toast_test_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR,
    large_jsonb JSONB,
    large_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
    ) FROM toast_test_source TABLE 'public.toast_test_table';
    ```

4. Verify the data in RisingWave.

    After a short wait for synchronization, you can query the table in RisingWave. The `octet_length` function confirms that the full, un-truncated data has been successfully ingested.

    ```sql
    SELECT
        id,
        name,
        octet_length(large_jsonb::text) + octet_length(large_text) as total_size_bytes,
        large_jsonb ? 'large_string' as has_large_string,
        large_jsonb ? 'nested_object' as has_nested_object
    FROM toast_test_table
    ORDER BY id;

    ----RESULT
    1 toast_record_1 17261 t t
    2 toast_record_2 17261 t t
    3 toast_record_3 17261 t t
    4 toast_record_4 17261 t t
    ```

### Use dbt to ingest data from PostgreSQL CDC

Here is an example of how to use dbt to ingest data from PostgreSQL CDC. In this dbt example, `source` and `table_with_connector` models will be used. For more details about these two models, please refer to [Use dbt for data transformations](/integrations/other/dbt#define-dbt-models).

First, we create a `source` model `pg_mydb.sql`.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='source') }}
CREATE SOURCE {{ this }} WITH (
    connector = 'postgres-cdc',
    hostname = '127.0.0.1',
    port = '8306',
    username = 'root',
    password = '123456',
    database.name = 'mydb',
    slot.name = 'mydb_slot'
);
```

And then we create a `table_with_connector` model `tt3.sql`.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table_with_connector') }}
CREATE TABLE {{ this }} (
    v1 integer primary key,
    v2 timestamp with time zone
) FROM {{ ref('pg_mydb') }} TABLE 'public.tt3';
```

### Extract metadata from sources

The `INCLUDE` clause allows you to ingest fields *not* included in the main Debezium payload (such as metadata). See [Extracting metadata from sources](/ingestion/extract-metadata-from-sources) for details. The available fields are:

*   `timestamp`
*   `partition`
*   `offset`
*   `database_name`
*   `collection_name`

### Automatically map upstream table schema

RisingWave supports automatically mapping the upstream table schema when creating a CDC table from a PostgreSQL CDC source. 
Instead of defining columns individually, you can use `*` when creating a table to ingest all columns from the source table. Note that `*` cannot be used if other columns are specified in the table creation process.

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (*) FROM <source_name> TABLE '<schema_name>.<table_name>';
```
### Automatic schema changes

<Tip>
**PREMIUM FEATURE**

This is a premium feature. For a comprehensive overview of all premium features and their usage, please see [RisingWave premium features](/get-started/premium-features).
</Tip>

RisingWave supports auto schema changes in Postgres CDC. It ensures that your RisingWave pipeline stays synchronized with any schema changes in the source database, reducing the need for manual updates and preventing inconsistencies.

Currently, RisingWave supports the `ALTER TABLE` command with the following operations, and we plan to add support for additional DDL operations in future releases.

* `ADD COLUMN [DEFAULT expr]`: Allows you to add a new column to an existing table. Only constant value expressions are supported for the default value.
* `DROP COLUMN`: Allows you to remove an existing column from a table.

To enable this feature, set `auto.schema.change = 'true'` in your PostgreSQL CDC source configuration:

```SQL
CREATE SOURCE pg_source WITH (
 connector = 'postgres-cdc',
 hostname = 'localhost',
 port = '5432',
 username = 'your_user',
 password = 'your_password',
 database.name = 'your_database',
 schema.name = 'public',
 auto.schema.change = 'true'
);
```

Create a RisingWave table from the PostgreSQL source:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR
)
FROM pg_source TABLE 'public.my_upstream_table';
```

Add columns to the PostgreSQL table and observe the changes in RisingWave:

```sql
-- In your PostgreSQL database:
ALTER TABLE my_upstream_table ADD COLUMN v1 VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE my_upstream_table ADD COLUMN v2 NUMERIC(5,2);
```

After the changes in the upstream table, the schema of the table in RisingWave will also be changed. You can verify this by running `DESCRIBE my_table;` in RisingWave.

```sql
-- In RisingWave:
DESCRIBE my_table;
```

### Ingest data from a partitioned table

RisingWave supports ingesting data from a partitioned table. To configure a publication for your CDC stream, PostgreSQL, by default, creates publications with `publish_via_partition_root = false`. This setting causes replication slot events to contain separate events for each partition, rather than for the root partitioned table.

If you need to read from the partitioned table, you should explicitly set this property to `TRUE` when creating a publication. Execute the following command in your upstream PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION publication_name FOR table_name WITH (publish_via_partition_root = true);
```

If you let RisingWave create the publication, it will automatically set `publish_via_partition_root = true`.

Please be aware that PostgreSQL does not support adding both a partitioned table and its individual partitions to the same publication; however, it does not generate an error if attempted. If you need to ingest data from both the root table and its partitions, you should create separate publications for each. Otherwise, you will not be able to read from the table partitions. Meanwhile, in RisingWave, you should create separate sources with dedicated publication names for the partitioned table and its partitions.

### Expression as a column

RisingWave allows users to define expressions as table columns. For example, in the SQL statement below, `next_id` is not a column from the source PostgreSQL table. Instead, it is a generated column that RisingWave computes dynamically while ingesting data. The value of `next_id` for each row is always equal to `id + 1`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar,
  next_id int AS id + 1,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) FROM pg_mydb TABLE 'public.person';
```

Currently, generated columns must appear at the end of the schema definition. If a column from the upstream source appears after a generated column, RisingWave will return an error. For example, the following statement will fail because `name`, an upstream column, is placed after the generated column `next_id`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  next_id int AS id + 1,
  name varchar,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) FROM pg_mydb TABLE 'public.person';
```

To avoid errors, ensure that all generated columns are positioned at the end of the schema definition.

### Time travel

RisingWave does not support time travel for the native PostgreSQL CDC connector.
