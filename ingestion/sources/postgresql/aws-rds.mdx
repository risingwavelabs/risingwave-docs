To connect RisingWave to an AWS RDS or Aurora PostgreSQL database for Change Data Capture (CDC), you need to configure your database to support logical replication.

### 1. Enable logical replication

Create or modify a custom parameter group for your database instance and set the following parameters:

*   **`rds.logical_replication`**: Set to `1`. This enables logical replication on the instance.
*   **`wal_level`**: This should automatically be set to `logical` when `rds.logical_replication` is enabled. You can verify this setting.

<Note>
For Aurora PostgreSQL, it is also recommended to set `rds.logical_wal_cache` to `0` to avoid a known data loss issue affecting certain versions (e.g., 14.5, 13.8, 12.12, 11.17).

If you plan to create multiple CDC sources, ensure `max_wal_senders` is greater than or equal to the number of sources.
</Note>

### 2. Apply the parameter group

Modify your RDS or Aurora instance to use the newly configured parameter group. This change typically requires a **reboot of the database instance** to take effect.

### 3. Grant required privileges

Connect to your database and grant the `rds_replication` role to your user. This role provides the necessary permissions to manage logical replication slots and stream data.

```sql
GRANT rds_replication TO <user_name>;
```

You also need to grant standard access privileges to the schemas and tables you want to capture:

```sql
-- Grant connection access to the database
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <user_name>;

-- Grant usage on the schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;

-- Grant select on all tables in the schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;
-- To grant access to future tables in the schema automatically:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <user_name>;
```

### Next step

Now that your database is configured, you can proceed to connect RisingWave.
