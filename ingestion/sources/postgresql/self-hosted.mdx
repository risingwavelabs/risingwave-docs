To connect RisingWave to a self-hosted PostgreSQL database for Change Data Capture (CDC), you need to configure your database to support logical replication.

## 1. Set `wal_level` to `logical`

In your `postgresql.conf` file or via a SQL client, set the `wal_level` parameter to `logical`.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

This change requires a **restart of your PostgreSQL server** to take effect.

<Note>
If you plan to create multiple CDC sources, ensure the `max_wal_senders` parameter in your `postgresql.conf` is greater than or equal to the number of sources you intend to create. The default value is typically 10.
</Note>

## 2. Create a dedicated replication user

Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user for replication. This user needs the `REPLICATION` and `LOGIN` attributes.

```sql
-- Create a new user with a secure password
CREATE USER <user_name> WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD '<your_password>';

-- Or, modify an existing user
ALTER USER <user_name> WITH REPLICATION LOGIN;
```

## 3. Grant required privileges

Grant the user the necessary privileges on the database and schemas you want to capture changes from.

```sql
-- Grant connection access to the database
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <user_name>;

-- If RisingWave needs to create the publication, grant CREATE privilege
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <user_name>;

-- Grant usage on the schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;

-- Grant select on all tables in the schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;
-- To grant access to future tables in the schema automatically:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <user_name>;
```

## Next step

Now that your database is configured, you can proceed to connect RisingWave.
