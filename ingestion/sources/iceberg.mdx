This guide explains how to connect RisingWave to your Apache Iceberg tables for *batch* data ingestion. RisingWave supports reading data from Iceberg tables stored on S3-compatible storage (including AWS S3 and MinIO) and Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

## Prerequisites

*   An existing Apache Iceberg table.
*   Access credentials for the underlying storage system (e.g., S3 access key and secret key).
*   Network connectivity between RisingWave and your storage system.
*   Know your Iceberg catalog type.

## Connect to Iceberg

RisingWave supports connecting to Iceberg using `CREATE SOURCE`.
Currently, RisingWave does not support creating a table backed by an Iceberg table using `CREATE TABLE ... WITH (connector=...)`.
If you create a table to store data, and ingest from the Iceberg source, the table is not an Iceberg table.

## Basic connection example (S3)

The following example shows how to connect to an Iceberg table stored on S3:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE iceberg_source
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    warehouse.path = 's3://your-bucket/path/to/iceberg/warehouse',
    database.name = 'your_iceberg_db',
    table.name = 'your_iceberg_table',
    s3.endpoint = 'http://your-s3-endpoint:port', -- e.g., 'http://minio:9000'
    s3.access.key = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    s3.secret.key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    s3.region = 'your-s3-region'  -- Optional if endpoint is specified
) ;
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

<Info>The example shows connecting to S3 compatible storage systems. For different catalog types and storage systems, please refer to [Apache Iceberg configuration options](/ingestion/sources/iceberg-config).</Info>

## Query data

You can select from an Iceberg source to query data from the Iceberg table in RisingWave.

```sql
SELECT * FROM iceberg_source;
```

## Create streaming jobs

<Note>
Support for creating streaming jobs directly from Iceberg sources was added in v2.3. If your Iceberg source was created **before** this version, you must recreate it to enable streaming job creation.
</Note>

You can create a materialized view or a sink from an Iceberg source to incrementally process and transform its data, similar to how you would with other supported sources.

Note that streaming ingestion only works for append-only iceberg tables.
Any delete or update operations will be ignored.

## Data type mapping

RisingWave converts data types from Iceberg to RisingWave according to the following table:

| Iceberg Type | RisingWave Type |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| boolean      | boolean         |
| integer      | int             |
| long         | bigint          |
| float        | real            |
| double       | double          |
| string       | varchar         |
| date         | date            |
| timestamptz  | timestamptz     |
| timestamp    | timestamp       |
| decimal      | decimal         |

## Time travel

RisingWave's Iceberg source supports time travel. Please refer to [Apache Iceberg configuration options](/ingestion/sources/iceberg-config#time-travel) for more details.

## System tables

RisingWave offers system tables to query Iceberg metadata. Please refer to [Apache Iceberg configuration options](/ingestion/sources/iceberg-config#system-tables) for more details.
