This page provides a complete reference for all configuration parameters used when connecting RisingWave to Apache Iceberg tables via the `WITH` clause of a `CREATE SOURCE` statement.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SOURCE [IF NOT EXISTS] source_name
WITH (
   connector='iceberg',
   connector_parameter='value', ...
);
```

<Note>
You don't need to specify the column names for the Iceberg source, as RisingWave can derive them from the Iceberg table metadata directly. Use the [DESCRIBE](/sql/commands/sql-describe) statement to view the column names and data types.
</Note>

## Parameters

For object storage configuration (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) and catalog configuration parameters, see:
- [Object storage configuration](/iceberg/configuration/object-storage)
- [Catalog configuration](/iceberg/configuration/catalogs)

### Source-specific parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                   | Required (Conditional)     |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `connector`             | Must be set to `'iceberg'`.                                                                                                                         | Yes      |
| `database.name`     | The name of the Iceberg database containing the table.         | Yes      |
| `table.name`            | The name of the Iceberg table to ingest data from.      | Yes      |
| `commit_checkpoint_interval` | Commit every N checkpoints (N > 0). Default value is 60.                                                           | No       |

## Time travel

RisingWave supports querying historical data from Iceberg tables (time travel). You can query data as of a specific timestamp or snapshot ID.

### Syntax

```sql
-- Query as of a timestamp (STRING format)
SELECT * FROM source_name FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[+-HH:MM]';

-- Query as of a timestamp (UNIX timestamp in seconds)
SELECT * FROM source_name FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF <unix_timestamp_seconds>;

-- Query as of a snapshot ID
SELECT * FROM source_name FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF <snapshot_id>;
```

### Examples

```sql
SELECT * FROM s FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00'; -- Example with timezone offset
SELECT * FROM s FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-04-10 12:34:56'; -- Example without timezone (local time)
SELECT * FROM s FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF 4102444800; -- Example with Unix timestamp
SELECT * FROM s FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF 3023402865675048688; -- Example with Snapshot ID
```

Note: When the timestamp includes timezone, you should use the `timestamp with time zone` type.

## System tables

RisingWave offers system tables for querying Iceberg metadata:

*   `rw_iceberg_files`: Contains information about the current data files of the Iceberg table.
*   `rw_iceberg_snapshots`: Contains information about all snapshots of the Iceberg table.

```sql
-- Query Iceberg data files
SELECT * FROM rw_iceberg_files;

-- Query Iceberg snapshots
SELECT * FROM rw_iceberg_snapshots;
```

## Data type mapping

For information on how RisingWave maps Iceberg data types to RisingWave data types, see the [Iceberg RisingWave data type mapping table](/ingestion/sources/iceberg#data-type-mapping).
