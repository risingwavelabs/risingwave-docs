To know the difference between stream processing and ad-hoc query, please refer to [Ad-hoc (on read) vs. Streaming (on write)](/processing/overview#ad-hoc-on-read-vs-streaming-on-write).

* **Streaming ingestion from external systems**: This is tied to a stream processing task, continuously monitoring and synchronizing changes from external systems.
* **Ad-hoc ingestion from external systems**: This is bound to an ad-hoc query, where RisingWave queries the current data from the external system for processing during the query.
* **Ingest via DML statements**: Like other databases, RisingWave allows users to directly insert and modify data in tables using DML statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
   * Additionally, with the `INSERT ... SELECT` statement, users can transform ad-hoc ingestion data into a streaming flow to the table, affecting the downstream streaming pipeline of the table. This can also be used for [bulk imports](#use-insert-select-to-do-bulk-ingestion).

## Ingest data from external systems

### Source

In RisingWave, **Source** is the most fundamental object used to connect to data from external systems. Here is a simple example of creating a source from Kafka.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE kafka_source (
  k int,
  v1 text,
  v2 text
)
WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  topic = 'topic_name',
  properties.bootstrap.server = 'message_queue:29092'
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

After creating a source, no actual data ingestion occurs. Data ingestion happens when a query that references the source is submitted.

* `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `CREATE SINK` statement will generate **streaming ingestion** jobs.

The following statement will continuously import data from the Kafka topic and store it in the materialized view `mv`.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv AS
SELECT *
FROM kafka_source;
```

* Also, queries can be executed directly on the source, and **ad-hoc ingestion** will happen during the query's processing, see more information in [directly query Kafka](/integrations/sources/kafka#query-kafka-timestamp).
```sql
SELECT * FROM source_name
WHERE _rw_kafka_timestamp > now() - interval '10 minute';
```

For specific source types, their support for streaming ingestion and ad-hoc ingestion varies. Please refer to [our documentation](/integrations/sources/overview) for the specific source.

### Table with connectors

For sources that support streaming ingestion, RisingWave supports the direct creation of tables on them.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_on_kafka (
  k int primary key,
  v1 text,
  v2 text)
WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  topic = 'topic_name',
  properties.bootstrap.server = 'message_queue:29092'
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

The statement will create a streaming job that continuously ingests data from the Kafka topic to the table and the data will be stored in RisingWave's internal storage, which brings the following benefits:

1. **Improved ad-hoc query performance:** When users execute queries such as `SELECT * FROM table_on_kafka`, the query engine will directly access the data from RisingWave's internal storage, eliminating unnecessary network overhead and avoiding read pressure on upstream systems. Additionally, users can create [indexes](/processing/indexes) on the table to accelerate queries.
2. **Allow defining primary keys:** With the help of its internal storage, RisingWave can efficiently maintain primary key constraints. Users can define a primary key on a specific column of the table and define different behaviors for primary key conflicts with [ON CONFLICT clause](/sql/commands/sql-create-table#pk-conflict-behavior).
3. **Ability to handle delete/update changes**: Based on the definition of primary keys, RisingWave can efficiently process upstream synchronized delete and update operations. For systems that synchronize delete/update operations from external systems, such as database's CDC and UPSERT format messages from message queues, we **do not** allow creating a source on it but require a table with connectors.
4. **Stronger consistency guarantee**: When using a table with connectors, all downstream jobs will be guaranteed to have a consistent view of the data persisted in the table; while for source, different jobs may see inconsistent results due to different ingestion speed or data retention in the external system.
5. **Greater flexibility**: Like regular tables, you can use DML statements like [INSERT](/sql/commands/sql-insert), [UPDATE](/sql/commands/sql-update) and [DELETE](/sql/commands/sql-delete) to insert or modify data in tables with connectors, and use [CREATE SINK INTO TABLE](/sql/commands/sql-create-sink-into) to merge other data streams into the table.

### Table-valued function

RisingWave supports using the table-valued function (TVF) `postgres_query` or `mysql_query` to directly query PostgreSQL or MySQL databases. This function connects to a specified instance, executes the provided SQL query, and returns the results as a table in RisingWave.

To use it, specify connection details (such as hostname, port, username, password, database name) and the desired SQL query. This makes it easier to integrate databases directly into RisingWave workflows without needing additional data transfer steps. For more information, see [Ingest data from Postgres tables](/integrations/sources/postgresql-table) and [Ingest data from MySQL tables](/integrations/sources/mysql-table).

## DML on tables

### Insert data into tables

You can load data in batch mode to RisingWave by [creating a table](/sql/commands/sql-create-table) and then [inserting](/sql/commands/sql-insert) data into it. For example, the statement below creates a table `website_visits` and inserts 5 rows of data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE website_visits (
  timestamp timestamp with time zone,
  user_id varchar,
  page_id varchar,
  action varchar
);

INSERT INTO website_visits (timestamp, user_id, page_id, action) VALUES
  ('2023-06-13T10:00:00Z', 'user1', 'page1', 'view'),
  ('2023-06-13T10:01:00Z', 'user2', 'page2', 'view'),
  ('2023-06-13T10:02:00Z', 'user3', 'page3', 'view'),
  ('2023-06-13T10:03:00Z', 'user4', 'page1', 'view'),
  ('2023-06-13T10:04:00Z', 'user5', 'page2', 'view');
```

### Use `INSERT SELECT` to do bulk ingestion

For sources that only support ad-hoc ingestion but not streaming ingestion, such as the [Iceberg source](/integrations/sources/apache-iceberg), `insert ... select ...` can be used to implement bulk data import into the table, and to convert the data into a stream of changes that are synchronized downstream to the table.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE source_iceberg_t1
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    catalog.type = 'storage',
    ...
    database.name = 's1',
    table.name = 't1'
);

CREATE TABLE t1(
  timestamp timestamp with time zone,
  user_id varchar,
  page_id varchar,
  action varchar
);

INSERT INTO t1 SELECT * FROM source_iceberg_t1;
```

## File source management

RisingWave supports reading data from file sources including AWS S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage.

### Batch reading from file source

<Note>
Added in version 2.1.
</Note>

To read data in batch from file sources, you need to create a materialized view from the source or create a table with the appropriate connector. You can also directly query the file source. Below are examples using AWS S3.

```sql
-- Create a source that connects to S3
CREATE SOURCE s3_source WITH ( connector = 's3', ... );

-- Create a materialized view from the source for batch processing
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv AS SELECT * FROM s3_source;

-- Create a table using the S3 connector
CREATE TABLE s3_table ( ... ) WITH ( connector = 's3', ... );

-- Select from the source directly
SELECT count(*) from s3_source;
```

### Data type mapping in Parquet

When using file source to read parquet files, please define the schema information according to the following mapping.

| Parquet data type | RisingWave file source data type |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| boolean      | boolean         |
| int16        | smallint        |
| int32        | int             |
| int64        | bigint          |
| float        | real            |
| double       | double precision|
| string       | varchar         |
| date         | date            |
| decimal      | decimal         |
| int8         | smallint        |
| uint8        | smallint        |
| uint16       | int             |
| uint32       | bigint          |
| uint64       | decimal         |
| float16      | double precision|
| `timestamp(_, Some(_))` | timestamptz  |
| `timestamp(_, None)`    | timestamp    |
