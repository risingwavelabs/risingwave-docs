sidebarTitle: Connecting with CREATE TABLE
description: "Connect to a data source and store the ingested data in RisingWave."
---

The `CREATE TABLE` command, when used with connector settings, connects to an external data source *and* continuously ingests the data into RisingWave's internal storage. This makes the data readily available for querying and analysis, even after your session ends.

Using `CREATE TABLE` with a connector provides several key benefits:

*   **Data storage:** Data is stored within RisingWave, so it's always available, even if the external source becomes unavailable.
*   **Improved query performance:** Queries against the table are generally faster because the data is stored locally within RisingWave.
*   **Primary key support:** You can define primary keys on tables, which ensures data consistency and enables efficient handling of updates and deletes (especially important for CDC sources).
*   **Historical analysis:** You can analyze historical data trends, not just the current stream of data.
*   **Indexes:** You can [create indexes](/sql/commands/sql-create-index) on tables to further optimize query performance.
*   **DML statements:** You can use standard SQL commands like [INSERT](/sql/commands/sql-insert), [UPDATE](/sql/commands/sql-update), and [DELETE](/sql/commands/sql-delete) to modify the data stored in the table.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name (
    column_name data_type [AS source_column_name] [NOT NULL],
    ...
    [, PRIMARY KEY (column_name, ...)]
)
WITH (
    connector='connector_name',
    connector_property='value',
    ...
)
FORMAT format_type ENCODE encode_type (
    ... -- Format-specific options
);
```

## Parameters

*   `CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name`: This is the command to create a table and connect it to a data source.
    *   `IF NOT EXISTS`: This part is *optional*. If you include `IF NOT EXISTS`, RisingWave will not return an error if a table with the same name already exists.
    *   `table_name`: This is a user-defined name for your table (e.g., `my_kafka_data`). Choose a descriptive name.

*   `(column_name data_type [AS source_column_name] [NOT NULL], ...)`: This section defines the *schema* of the data you are ingesting. It's a comma-separated list of column definitions.
    *   `column_name`: The name you want to use for the column within RisingWave (e.g., `user_id`).
    *   `data_type`: The RisingWave data type of the column (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP`). See [Data Types](/sql/data-types/overview) for a complete list of supported types.
    *   `AS source_column_name`: This part is *optional*. Use `AS` if the column name in the *source* is different from the name you want to use in RisingWave. For example: `user_id INT AS external_id`.
    *   `NOT NULL`: This part is *optional*. Use it to specify that a column cannot contain `NULL` values.

*   `[, PRIMARY KEY (column_name, ...)]`: This part is *optional* in general but *required* when using `UPSERT` formats (to handle updates and deletes). The primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table.

*   `WITH (connector='connector_name', connector_property='value', ...)`: This section specifies the connector to use and its connection properties.
    *   `connector`: This is *required*. It specifies the name of the connector to use (e.g., `'kafka'`, `'pulsar'`, `'s3'`). See [Sources](/ingestion/getting-started/sources) for a list of available connectors.
    *   `connector_property='value'`: These are *connector-specific* settings. The available properties and their required values depend on the connector you are using. See the documentation for each individual connector for details (e.g., for Kafka, you'll need to specify `topic` and `properties.bootstrap.server`).

*   `FORMAT format_type ENCODE encode_type (...)`: This section specifies how the data is formatted and encoded.
    *   `FORMAT`: This is *required*. It specifies the high-level data format (e.g., `PLAIN`, `UPSERT`, `DEBEZIUM`).
    *   `ENCODE`: This is *required*. It specifies the specific data encoding (e.g., `JSON`, `AVRO`, `PROTOBUF`).
    *   `(...)`: These are *format- and encoding-specific* options. The available options depend on the chosen `FORMAT` and `ENCODE`. See [Data formats and encoding options](/ingestion/getting-started/formats-and-encoding-options) for details.

## Example (Kafka)

This example creates a table named `my_kafka_table` that connects to a Kafka topic named `user_activity`. The data from the Kafka topic will be continuously ingested and stored in RisingWave. A primary key is defined on the `user_id` column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_kafka_table (
    user_id INT,
    product_id VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
) WITH (
    connector='kafka',
    topic='user_activity',
    properties.bootstrap.server='broker1:9092,broker2:9092'
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```
