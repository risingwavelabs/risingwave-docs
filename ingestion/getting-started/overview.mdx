RisingWave lets you connect to various external data sources, ingest data for real-time processing, and make the results available to applications. This overview explains the core concepts and primary methods for working with data in RisingWave.

## Key concepts

*   **Source:** A connection to an external data source (for example, Kafka, PostgreSQL, or S3). Creating a source, by itself, does *not* store data within RisingWave.
*   **Table:** Represents data stored within RisingWave's internal storage. There are two main types:
    *   **Standard (batch) tables:** Created using a regular `CREATE TABLE` statement *without* a `WITH` clause. You populate these tables manually (for example, using `INSERT` statements).
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE my_batch_table (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR
        );
        ```
    *   **Streaming (connector-backed) tables:** Created using a `CREATE TABLE ... WITH (connector=...)` statement.  These tables are automatically and continuously populated by ingesting data from an external source.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE my_streaming_table (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            value VARCHAR
        ) WITH (
            connector='kafka',
            topic='my_topic',
            properties.bootstrap.server='localhost:9092'
        ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
        ```
*   **Connector:** A built-in component that enables RisingWave to interface with a specific type of data source or sink (for example, Kafka or PostgreSQL).
*   **Materialized view:**  A *continuously updated* view of data.  Unlike a regular (non-materialized) view, which is just a stored query, a materialized view in RisingWave *stores the results* of the query and *automatically updates* those results as new data arrives from the underlying source(s) or table(s). Materialized views are *streaming jobs*.
*   **Sink:**  A *streaming job* that continuously delivers data from RisingWave to an *external system* (for example, Kafka, PostgreSQL, or cloud storage).  **Creating a sink is optional.** Applications can also directly query data within RisingWave.

## Primary ingestion methods

RisingWave provides two primary commands for connecting to external data sources:

1.  **`CREATE SOURCE` (data not stored):**

    *   **Description:** Establishes a connection to a data source *without* storing the data permanently in RisingWave.
    *   **Use cases:**
        *   Quickly inspecting data from a source.
        *   Building streaming pipelines using *materialized views* and/or *sinks*.
        *   Running one-time queries against the source.
    *   **Data availability:** Data is typically available only while your RisingWave session is active (the exact behavior depends on the specific source connector).
    *   **Learn more:** [Connecting with `CREATE SOURCE`](/ingestion/getting-started/connect-with-create-source)

2.  **`CREATE TABLE ... WITH (connector=...)` (data stored, continuous ingestion):**

    *   **Description:** Creates a *streaming (connector-backed) table*. This establishes a connection to a data source *and* continuously ingests the data into RisingWave's internal storage.
    *   **Use cases:** Historical analysis, improved query performance, primary key support, CDC handling.
    *   **Data availability:** Data is stored and remains available.
    *   **Learn More:** [Connecting with `CREATE TABLE`](/ingestion/getting-started/connect-with-create-table)

**Choosing a method:** Use `CREATE SOURCE` for temporary connections, quick exploration, or to build streaming pipelines with materialized views and/or sinks. Use `CREATE TABLE ... WITH (connector=...)` for continuous ingestion when you need to store the *full raw data* for historical analysis or other benefits.

## Typical data flow in RisingWave

A common pattern in RisingWave is to:

1.  **Ingest data from external sources using `CREATE SOURCE` or `CREATE TABLE ... WITH (connector=...)`.**
2.  **(Optional) Create *materialized views* to transform the data.** Materialized views are *streaming jobs* that continuously process incoming data from sources or tables and store the *results* in RisingWave. This is an efficient way to build streaming pipelines.
3.  **(Optional) Create *sinks* using `CREATE SINK` to deliver processed data to external systems.** Sinks are also *streaming jobs* that continuously send data to their destination. Applications can also connect *directly* to RisingWave and query the results of materialized views or tables *without* a sink.

## Copying data from a source to a table

You can create a connection with `CREATE SOURCE` and then *manually* copy data into a *standard (batch) table* using `INSERT INTO ... SELECT`:

```sql
-- Create a connection (data not stored)
CREATE SOURCE my_source ...;

-- Create a standard table
CREATE TABLE my_batch_table (...);

-- Copy data from the source to the table
INSERT INTO my_batch_table SELECT * FROM my_source;
```

This is useful for one-time data loading or transformations before storing data. 

## Supported data sources

RisingWave supports a wide range of data sources, including:

*   **Message queues:** Apache Kafka, Redpanda, Pulsar
*   **Databases (via CDC):** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB
*   **Cloud storage:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
*   **Others:** NATS JetStream, MQTT, Apache Iceberg

See [Supported data sources](/ingestion/getting-started/sources) for a complete list. RisingWave uses *connectors* to interface with each source.

## Supported data formats and encodings

RisingWave supports various data formats and encodings. See [Data formats and encoding options](/ingestion/getting-started/formats-and-encoding-options) for details.
