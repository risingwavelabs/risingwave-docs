description: "Describes how Change Data Capture (CDC) is handled in RisingWave"
---
RisingWave provides native connectors for ingesting Change Data Capture streams from databases like Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. With these CDC connectors, you can ingest CDC data from these databases directly, without setting up additional services like Kafka. For detailed syntax, parameters, and step-by-step guides, please refer to specific sections.

- [PostgreSQL CDC](/ingestion/sources/postgresql/pg-cdc)
- [MySQL CDC](/ingestion/sources/mysql/mysql-cdc)
- [SQL Server CDC](/ingestion/sources/sql-server-cdc)
- [MongoDB CDC](/ingestion/sources/mongodb-cdc)

You can also use event streaming systems like Apache Kafka, Pulsar, or Kinesis to stream changes from MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server to RisingWave. In this case, you will need an additional CDC tool to stream the changes from the database and specify the corresponding formats when ingesting the streams into RisingWave. RisingWave documentation does not provide instructions about this approach.
