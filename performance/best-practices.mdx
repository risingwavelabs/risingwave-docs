This section outlines best practices for optimizing RisingWave performance.  Applying these recommendations can help you achieve lower latency, higher throughput, and more efficient resource utilization.  These best practices cover various aspects of working with RisingWave, from data modeling and query writing to resource allocation and data ingestion.

## Data modeling

Proper data modeling is a foundational aspect of achieving good performance. How you structure your data and define your sources and tables can significantly impact query efficiency.

### When to create a source or declare `append only` on a table?

In RisingWave, you can declare a source, a table, and an append-only table when connecting to an external upstream system. The key difference lies in whether RisingWave persists the ingested data and whether modifications are allowed:

*   **Source:** Data is *not* persisted within RisingWave. This is suitable for scenarios where you only need to process the data stream and don't need to store it within RisingWave itself.
*   **Table:** Data *is* persisted within RisingWave, and you can insert, delete, and update data. This provides the most flexibility but also consumes more storage space.
*   **Append-only table:** Data *is* persisted, but you can *only* insert new data. You cannot delete or update existing data. This offers performance advantages for certain types of queries.

The difference between the source and the two types of tables is that a source does not persist the ingested data within RisingWave while the tables do. When the data is stored within RisingWave, it gives users the ability to insert, delete, and update data to a table and only insert data to an append-only table. Therefore, users make a tradeoff between taking up more storage space and giving up the ability to modify source data within RisingWave. See details in [CREATE SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-create-source).

Another difference is the performance implication. Unlike the table, the source and the append-only table will never process any updates or deletes. This gives us opportunities for optimization.

Suppose we have a materialized view that tracks the maximal account balance among all the clients at a retail bank, e.g., `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW max_account_balance AS SELECT max(balance) FROM account_table`. Since the account balance of each client is frequently changing, we cannot declare it as a source or an append-only table. Then RisingWave has to persist the balances from all the accounts to maintain the result, such as finding how much the second largest balance is when the first largest balance decreases.

Suppose we have another materialized view that tracks the time of the latest transaction among all the transactions, e.g., `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW time_latest_transaction AS SELECT max(timestamp) FROM transactions`. Since the transaction is irreversible (even if one transaction is a mistake, we correct it with a new transaction), it is perfect for us to declare transactions as a source or an append-only table. Then RisingWave only needs to keep a single data point, i.e., the timestamp of the latest transaction, and simply compare it with the timestamp of a new transaction to update the result.

This append-only versus non-append-only difference can make an impact in a few use cases:

1.  Over-window functions with an `ORDER BY` clause and are only interested in the top N rows.
2.  Deduplication.
3.  Join.

## Resource allocation

Efficient resource allocation is crucial for achieving optimal performance and avoiding bottlenecks.

### When to scale up or scale out computation and compaction resources?

The discussion is limited to compute nodes and compactor nodes as other components are not involved in processing in most cases.

RisingWave was built as a scalable distributed processing system from day one. However, just like any other distributed system, being a distributed system introduces extra overhead as there is more network communication among different machines. Moreover, resource fragmentation is more likely to appear with more machines splitting the same total amount of resources. We remark that this is the intrinsic nature of a distributed system but not a special limitation of RisingWave itself.

Therefore, we generally prefer scaling up over scaling out for compute nodes. If the streaming queries are mostly stateless (i.e., those without aggregation, join, or over window functions) and do not involve data shuffling, then scaling up and scaling out is the same. If you are experiencing high latency or slow stream processing, see [Troubleshooting - High Latency](/performance/troubleshoot-high-latency).

In terms of compactor nodes, we favor scaling up when the resources of the compactor node are less than 4 CPU and 8 GB memory. This is because some compaction tasks can occasionally be quite resource-intensive and use up to 4 CPU and 8 GB memory. However, once the resource of the compactor node exceeds this threshold, both scaling up and scaling out are equally fine. See [Monitoring and metrics - Resource utilization](/performance/metrics#resource-utilization) to monitor CPU and memory usage, and [Monitoring and Metrics - Compaction](/performance/metrics#compaction) for compaction-related metrics.


## Query optimization

Writing efficient SQL queries is a critical aspect of achieving good performance.

You can checkout the following pages for more details on SQL optimization:

- [Streaming SQL Optimization](/performance/streaming-optimizations)

## Backfilling optimization
Backfilling refers to the operation where a query processes all existing or historical data.

### How to speed up backfilling

Suppose we have 100 GB of data in an upstream Kafka topic, with new data continuously flowing in. When we define a query to ingest data from this topic, it first processes all existing data, and this is the backfilling stage. Afterward, it continues to process new incoming data.

RisingWave always tries to ingest and process data as quickly as possible, so the backfilling stage tends to saturate cluster resources. Backfilling performance often worsens with more complex queries, such as large materialized view (MV) or sink queries with many common table expressions (CTEs) or subqueries. While these queries might be efficient for ongoing processing, they may not be ideal for backfilling when the cluster is overloaded.

The reason is straightforward: running a query with 10 CTEs or subqueries is similar to running 10 different queries simultaneously. This can lead to serious resource competition:

*   Memory: There may not be enough memory to hold the state of all stateful operators in the query, resulting in high cache miss rates and high remote I/O operations per second (IOPS). See [Monitoring and Metrics - Cache Performance](/performance/metrics#cache-performance).
*   CPU: The block cache and meta cache become very busy bringing in and evicting data. Data must be deserialized before operators can use it, consuming more CPU.
*   Remote I/O bandwidth: Due to memory constraints, RisingWave may hit object storage (e.g., S3/GCS) rate limits more frequently.

Note that this resource competition doesn't simply mean each of the 10 queries gets 1/10 of the total resources. Extra overhead and limitations can lead to even worse performance than 1/10 of the original.

If you observe high CPU utilization or high cache miss rates during backfilling of a large, complex query, we suggest decomposing it into several independent queries and creating each materialized view one by one. This approach could significantly improve performance. See [Troubleshooting - High latency](/performance/troubleshoot-high-latency).

### How to optimize backfilling

During the backfilling process of the "MV on MV" or "MV on SINK INTO TABLE", the data from the upstream MV may not have good locality. To optimize this, we recommend modifying the SQL query so that the order key of the upstream table aligns with the group key of the downstream MV. This alignment improves the performance of the backfilling process and ensures better efficiency.

### MV on MV
Suppose we create a table `t` using `create table t(v1 int, v2 varchar, v3 timestamp);`. This table contains a large amount of historical data. When creating a new MV on top of this table, it requires backfilling all the historical data, which can be a time-consuming process. Then we create an MV called `m` using `create materialized view m as select v1, sum(v2) from t group by v1;`. The challenge during backfilling is that when reading data from table `t` to build the MV `m`, the order of the `v1` values may be random. This randomness can lead to poor cache locality and trigger remote I/O, ultimately decreasing performance.

However, if we use `create table t(v1 int primary key, v2 varchar);` instead to create a table, or define an intermediate mv like `create materialized view tmp as select * from t order by v1;`. The storage of RisingWave will order rows by `v1`, which means that rows with same `v1` will be read consecutively. This adjustment enhances cache locality and thereby improves performance.

### MV on SINK INTO TABLE

When building the MV on a table populated via SINK (SINK INTO TABLE), backfilling performance can be improved by ensuring the sink writes data in an order that matches the MV’s partitioning or ordering keys.

For example, if the MV uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY updated_at DESC)`, writing sink data ordered by `order_id`, `updated_at` helps store related rows consecutively. This improves data locality and allows the MV to backfill more efficiently by reducing random I/O and increasing cache hit rates.

## Using materialized views

Materialized views (MVs) can significantly improve query performance by pre-computing and storing results.

### When to use MVs on MVs

When building a materialized view (MV), it is possible to build more MVs on top of the existing one. This approach is similar to creating complex functionalities by composing simple functions in a codebase. The benefits of building MVs on MVs include:

-   Simplifying complex queries, reducing redundancy, and thus lowering the amount of resources needed. A typical use case arises when aggregating certain metrics along different time dimensions. For example, tracking the number of orders per minute, hour, and day. We can build an MV that aggregates by minute, build another MV on top of it that aggregates by hour, and finally, add yet another MV on top of the hourly one that aggregates by day.
-   Providing a consistent interface for users to access frequently used data, while also shielding them from the underlying complexity of the schema changes of the source data in third-party systems.

Users may have concerns if decomposing a complex pipeline into multiple MVs introduces additional performance overhead. We remark that more decomposition does not lead to more computation overhead but only more storage space. Since RisingWave is typically deployed with cheap object store on the public cloud to store large amounts of data, we generally consider it a less crucial factor in most cases.

## Data ingestion

Efficient data ingestion is crucial for maintaining low latency and high throughput in your streaming pipelines.

### How to monitor the progress of direct CDC

To effectively monitor the progress of direct Change Data Capture (CDC), you can employ two key methods tailored to historical and real-time data for PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. For more details, see [Use Direct CDC for PostgreSQL](/integrations/sources/postgresql-cdc#monitor-the-progress-of-direct-cdc) and [Use Direct CDC for MySQL](/integrations/sources/mysql-cdc#monitor-the-progress-of-direct-cdc).
