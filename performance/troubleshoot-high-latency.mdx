High latency, manifesting as slow stream processing in RisingWave, is a common performance problem. It indicates that data is not being processed as quickly as expected, leading to delays and potential backlogs. This guide helps you identify the root causes of high latency and provides effective solutions.

## Symptoms

Several symptoms can indicate high latency and slow stream processing:

*   **High barrier latency:** Examine the **Barrier Latency** panel in the **Grafana dashboard (dev)** > **Streaming** section. A consistently high latency curve indicates that barriers are getting stuck, signifying a slowdown in the streaming pipeline. See [Monitoring and metrics - Barrier monitoring](/performance/metrics#barrier-monitoring) for details.

*   **Backpressure:** Observe the **Actor Output Blocking Time Ratio (Backpressure)** panel in **Grafana dashboard (dev)** > **Streaming Actors**. High backpressure between fragments indicates that a downstream component is unable to keep up with the upstream data flow. See [Workload analysis](/performance/workload-analysis) for more details.
*   **Low source throughput:** Check [Source throughput](/performance/metrics#source-throughput) to see if the input is the cause.  Low throughput from the source, *without* significant backpressure, often indicates a problem with the upstream system itself.
*   **Data lag:** If RisingWave is falling behind in processing data, this indicates a slowdown. This might be observed as a growing delay between when data is generated in the upstream source and when it's reflected in RisingWave's materialized views.
*   **Increasing number of barriers:** A steadily increasing number of uncollected barriers is a sign of processing delays.

## Potential causes

High latency and slow stream processing can be caused by a variety of factors.  These factors often interact, so you may need to investigate multiple potential causes:

### Backpressure

When a downstream actor or fragment processes data slower than its upstream counterpart, it creates backpressure. This pressure propagates upstream, eventually causing the source to slow down its data ingestion.  Backpressure is often a *symptom* of an underlying issue (like resource constraints or an inefficient query), but it can also be a cause of further slowdowns.

### Resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk I/O)

Insufficient CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources can significantly limit the processing capacity of your streaming jobs.  If RisingWave doesn't have enough resources, it will take longer to process data. See [Monitoring and metrics - Resource utilization](/performance/metrics#resource-utilization), [Best practices - Resource allocation](/performance/best-practices#resource-allocation), and [Specific bottlenecks](/performance/specific-bottlenecks) for more information.

### Slow upstream sources

If RisingWave is ingesting data from a slow upstream source (e.g., a message queue with limited bandwidth or a slow database), this can create a bottleneck *regardless* of RisingWave's internal performance.

### Network issues

Network connectivity problems between RisingWave components or between RisingWave and external systems (e.g., S3, the upstream source, message queues) can introduce delays.

### Inefficient queries

Poorly written SQL queries used to *create* materialized views or sources can significantly impact streaming performance. Common issues include:

*   **Heavy aggregations:**  Functions like `array_agg` can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets or high cardinality grouping.
*   **Joins with unreasonable amplification:** Joining tables on low-cardinality columns (columns with few distinct values) can result in a massive increase in the number of rows processed, slowing down the join operation.
<Note>
The term "Cardinality" describes how many distinct values exist in a column. For example, a "nation" column often has a lower cardinality, while a "user_id" column often has a higher cardinality.  When using a low-cardinality column as the equal condition for a join, such as `A join B on A.nation = B.nation`, any operation on a row in A or B will be amplified by the join, potentially leading to performance issues.
</Note>
*   **Using `UNION` instead of `UNION ALL`:** The `UNION` operator removes duplicate rows, which requires extra processing. If you don't need to deduplicate rows, use `UNION ALL` for significantly better performance.
*   **UDF performance issues:**  Slow User-Defined Functions (UDFs) can become a bottleneck.
*   **Improper configuration:** Incorrect configuration settings can negatively impact performance.

## Diagnosis

### General approach

1.  **Check barrier latency and number:** Start by examining the "Barrier Latency" and "Barrier Number" panels in Grafana, as described in the "Symptoms" section.
2.  **Analyze backpressure:** Go to **Grafana dashboard (dev)** > **Streaming Actors** > **Actor Output Blocking Time Ratio (Backpressure)** panel and analyze backpressure between fragments.  High backpressure points to a bottleneck in the downstream fragment.
3.  **Examine await tree dump:** Check the Await Tree Dump of all compute nodes in **RisingWave Dashboard** hosted on `http://meta-node:5691`. If the barrier is stuck, the Await Tree Dump will reveal which operation it's waiting for, helping you pinpoint the problematic part of your streaming pipeline.

    To help identify bottlenecks in the await tree, you can use the [Await-Tree Analyzer](https://risingwavelabs.github.io/rw-diagnose-tools/) for analysis. This tool is also available for self-hosting, please consult the [repository](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/rw-diagnose-tools) for setup instructions.

4.  **Examine resource utilization:** Check CPU usage, memory usage, and cache miss ratios as described in [Monitoring and metrics](/performance/metrics). This will help you identify potential resource constraints.
5.  **Simplify the query:** If you suspect an inefficient query, try removing parts of the SQL query (e.g., individual `JOIN` clauses, `WHERE` conditions, or complex functions) to isolate the specific part causing the slowdown.
6.  **Check for errors:** Examine RisingWave's logs for any error messages.

### Identifying specific causes

#### Identify back-pressured fragments

![Actors and Fragments](/images/actors-and-fragments.png)

To find the root of backpressure, identify the *frontmost* back-pressured fragments in the DAG. Use the Grafana dashboard and navigate to the "Streaming - Backpressure" panel. Find channels with high backpressure and identify the one furthest upstream.

![Backpressure panel](/images/backpressure-panel.png)

For example, in the image above, both `15002→15001` and `15003→15002` show high backpressure. Since backpressure propagates upstream, the root cause is likely fragment `15001`.

To correlate this with your SQL query, use the RisingWave Dashboard and access the "Fragment" panel. You can also run `EXPLAIN CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW …` to see the query plan and identify the part of the query corresponding to the problematic fragments.

#### Resource constraints

If you suspect resource constraints, refer to [Specific bottlenecks](/performance/specific-bottlenecks) for detailed guidance on diagnosing specific resource limitations (CPU, memory, storage, etc.). High CPU utilization, consistently high memory usage, or high cache miss ratios are key indicators.

#### Slow upstream sources

If the [Source throughput](/performance/metrics#source-throughput) is lower than expected, and other metrics don't indicate internal bottlenecks, the upstream source may be the limiting factor.

#### Network issues

RisingWave does not have specific network metrics. If other metrics and the upstream source appear healthy, investigate potential network connectivity problems.

#### Inefficient queries

Examine the SQL queries used to create your materialized views and sources. Look for the common issues listed under "Potential causes" above. Specifically, look for signs of high join amplification:

You can find this panel through **Grafana dashboard (dev)** > **Streaming** > **Join Executor Matched Rows**, which indicates the number of matched rows from the opposite side in the streaming join executors.

![High Join Amplification](/images/example_high_join_matched_rows.png)

At the same time, a log of `high_join_amplification` with the problematic join keys will be printed, such as

````bash
hash_join_amplification: large rows matched for join key matched_rows_len=200000 update_table_id=31 match_table_id=33 join_key=OwnedRow([Some(Int32(1)), Some(Utf8("abc"))]) actor_id=119 fragment_id=30
````

## Solutions

### General strategies

*   **Optimize queries:** The *most effective* way to improve performance is often to improve the efficiency of your SQL queries used to *create* materialized views and sources. See [Best practices - Query optimization](/performance/best-practices#query-optimization) for general guidance.
*   **Increase resources:** If resource constraints are the issue, consider scaling up (adding more resources to existing nodes) or scaling out (adding more nodes). See [Best practices - Resource allocation](/performance/best-practices#resource-allocation).
*   **Address upstream bottlenecks:** If the upstream source is slow, you'll need to address the bottleneck in the upstream system itself.
*   **Address network issues:** Troubleshoot network connectivity.

### Specific solutions for each cause

#### Backpressure

*   **Rewrite queries:** Simplify or optimize the queries used to create your materialized views and sources. Focus on reducing the load on the bottleneck fragments identified during diagnosis.  This might involve restructuring joins, adding filters, or optimizing aggregations.
*   **Increase parallelism:** If a specific fragment is a bottleneck due to computational limitations, increasing its parallelism (if possible) can help distribute the workload. See [Best practices - Resource allocation](/performance/best-practices#resource-allocation).
*   **Address resource constraints:** Underlying resource limitations can *cause* backpressure. See [Specific bottlenecks](/performance/specific-bottlenecks) for detailed guidance.

#### Resource constraints

Increase CPU, memory, or disk cache (if available). See [Best practices - Resource allocation](/performance/best-practices#resource-allocation) and [Specific bottlenecks](/performance/specific-bottlenecks) for detailed guidance.

#### Slow upstream sources

Address the bottleneck in the upstream system (e.g., increase resources for your message queue or database).

#### Network issues

Troubleshoot network connectivity between RisingWave components and external systems.

#### Inefficient queries

*   **Reduce join amplification:**
    *   **Rewrite the query:**  Use better join conditions or restructure your query to minimize the number of rows produced by joins. See [Maintain wide table with table sinks](/processing/maintain-wide-table-with-table-sinks) for details.
    *   **Use the workaround:** If you have identified specific join keys causing high amplification, you can split the original materialized view into multiple materialized views with filtering conditions to distribute the workload:

        For example, for this join:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM orders
        INNER JOIN product_description
        ON orders.product_id = product_description.product_id
        ```

        If `product_id = 1` is a hot-selling product causing amplification, split the materialized view:

        1.  Create one MV with `orders.user_id % 7 = 0`.
        2.  Create another with `orders.user_id % 7 = 1`.
        3.  Repeat up to `orders.user_id % 7 = 6`.

        If `user_id` is not directly usable with modulo, use a hash function: `hash_value(orders.user_id)`. Account for negative hash values: `hash_value(orders.user_id) % 7 = -1/-2/-3/-4/-5/-6`.

        Finally, `UNION ALL` the results from all the materialized views.
*   **Optimize heavy aggregations:** Consider alternative aggregation strategies, pre-aggregate data if possible, or use approximations if acceptable for your use case.
*   **Use `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`:** If you don't need to deduplicate rows, use `UNION ALL`.
*   **Improve UDF performance:** Optimize your UDF code or consider alternative approaches if UDFs are a bottleneck.
