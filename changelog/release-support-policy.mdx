---

This document summarizes support end dates for recent RisingWave releases **and** provides a comprehensive overview of the software release lifecycle, including the versioning scheme, release cadence, and the detailed version support and deprecation policy. It helps users of RisingWave Cloud and the on-premises Premium edition understand how long different versions are supported and plan upgrades accordingly.

This policy focuses on *software versions*. For the lifecycle and deprecation of *individual features*, see [RisingWave feature lifecycle and deprecation](/changelog/product-lifecycle).

## Support end dates for recent releases

The following table summarizes support end dates for recent RisingWave releases. Refer to the detailed policy below for the rules governing these dates.

## Policy details

### 1. Software versioning model (Semantic Versioning)

RisingWave adheres to the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) standard, using a three-part numbering system: `Major.Minor.Patch`. Understanding this scheme is crucial for interpreting the support policy.

*   **Major version (e.g., `2.0.0`):** Represents significant, milestone releases. These releases often introduce substantial new features, architectural changes, and *may include breaking changes*. Breaking changes might require data migration or adjustments to user workflows.
*   **Minor version (e.g., `2.1.0`):** Represents regular releases with new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Minor versions are designed to be *backward compatible* within the same major version. Upgrading between minor versions within the same major release (e.g., `2.1.0` to `2.2.0`) should not break existing functionality unless explicitly communicated.
*   **Patch version (e.g., `2.1.1`):** Represents releases focused solely on bug fixes and security patches. Patch versions do not introduce new features or breaking changes.

### 2. Release cadence

RisingWave aims for a predictable release schedule:

*   **Major versions:** Typically released annually.
*   **Minor versions:** Typically released every 45 days.
*   **Patch versions:** Released as needed to address critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Version support and deprecation policy

This section defines the rules for discontinuing support for older RisingWave versions. "Support" includes providing bug fixes, security patches, and technical assistance. When support ends, a version is considered deprecated.

*   **3.1 Major version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a major version ends 4 months *after* the release of the subsequent major version.

    *   **Example:** If RisingWave `3.0.0` is released on September 1st, 2025, then support for all `2.x.x` versions (e.g., `2.10.5`, `2.9.1`, `2.0.0`) ends on January 1st, 2026. This provides a 4-month window for users to migrate.

*   **3.2 Minor version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a minor version continues for a minimum of 2.5 months, *or* until two newer minor versions have been released, *whichever period is longer*.

    *   **Example 1 (Minimum duration applies):** Version `2.1.0` is released on January 1st. The next two minor versions (`2.2.0`, `2.3.0`) are released quickly, by March 1st (less than 2.5 months later). Because the 2.5-month minimum duration is longer than the time it took to release two newer versions, support for `2.1.0` continues until March 15th (2.5 months after its January 1st release).

    *   **Example 2 (Two newer versions apply):** Version `2.1.0` is released on January 1st, 2025. Versions `2.2.0` and `2.3.0` are released on February 15th and March 30th respectively. Support for `2.1.0` ends on March 30th, 2025 (when `2.3.0` is released), as this is *longer* than the 2.5-month minimum.

<Note>To address performance issues observed with etcd, we **strongly encourage** all users of RisingWave v2.0 and earlier to upgrade to v2.1. Starting with v2.1, RisingWave supports SQL backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite) for metadata storage. Migrating to a SQL backend provides benefits such as improved stability, performance, and observability.</Note>

*   **3.3 Backporting policy:**

    *   Critical bug fixes and security patches are backported to a limited set of supported, non-deprecated versions. This ensures users receive essential updates even if not on the absolute latest version. Fixes are typically applied to:
        *   The latest released minor version.
        *   The minor version currently undergoing release testing.
        *   *Potentially*, one past major version, if it is still within its support window (see section 3.1). This is evaluated case-by-case.

    *   **Example:** On March 5th, 2025, assume:
        *   Version `2.3.0` is undergoing release testing.
        *   Version `2.2.0` is the latest released version.
        *   Version `1.10.0` is from a previous major release but is still supported (within the 4-month window after `2.0.0` was released).

        In this scenario, critical fixes would be backported to `2.3.0`, `2.2.0`, and potentially `1.10.0`. Backporting to `2.1.0` would generally *not* occur if `2.3.0` had already been released (based on the minor version deprecation rule).

*   **3.4 Exceptions:**

    *   In exceptional circumstances (e.g., critical security vulnerabilities, severe performance issues, legal requirements), a version may be deprecated, and support removed with *shorter notice* than outlined above. RisingWave will make every effort to inform users promptly in such cases.

### 4. RisingWave Cloud specifics

*   RisingWave Cloud users receive notifications about version deprecation directly through the cloud portal and potentially via email.
*   The upgrade process for deprecated versions may be automated using published maintenance windows. Details on automation will be provided when available.
*   Until automation is fully implemented, the RisingWave Cloud SRE team coordinates with customers regarding necessary upgrades to stay within supported versions.

### 5. Communication and user support

RisingWave communicates version support changes and upcoming deprecations clearly and proactively.

*   **5.1 Communication channels:** Information is shared via:
    *   Product release newsletter
    *   Blog posts
    *   Release notes
    *   Direct emails (to potentially affected users)
    *   In-product notifications (within RisingWave Cloud)

*   **5.2 Content of notifications:** Deprecation notices typically include:
    *   The specific version(s) being deprecated (e.g., "RisingWave 1.5.x").
    *   A clear timeline: announcement date, end-of-support date (deprecation date).
    *   Guidance on migration paths and resources.

*   **5.3 Advance notice:**
    *   RisingWave provides at least *2 months'* notice before support ends for a *major* version. The exact timeline considers the impact of the new major release. Notice for minor version deprecation is implicit in the release cadence and the policy rules (section 3.2).

*   **5.4 Migration support:** Where applicable, RisingWave provides tools, documentation (like migration guides), and support resources to assist with upgrades to supported versions.

*   **5.5 Feedback mechanism:** User feedback on the deprecation process and migration experience is encouraged through standard channels (e.g., forums, support tickets).
