<Update label="v2.7.0" description="2025-12-13">

Support for certain earlier version will end following the release of v2.7, please plan your upgrade to a newer version soon to ensure continued support and updates. For more details, see our [version support policy](/changelog/release-support-policy).

## Upgrade-time behavior changes

In v2.7.0, following the refactoring of `sink-into-table`, the system will automatically migrate fragments of all legacy tables to a unified pattern.

- **Migration process**: Upon upgrading and starting the cluster, a background task will automatically initiate the migration for all tables. You can see meta logs like:
    - `"migrated table fragments table_id={table_id}"` indicate a successful migration.
    - `"failed to migrate legacy table fragments"` indicate an error on migration.
- **Impact**: Migration errors triggering these logs will not affect existing jobs or system availability. The system will continuously retry the migration.
    - If the migration fails but does not impact your usage, please report the issue via Slack or GitHub issue and wait for bug fix in the next version.
    - To disable automatic migration, set `enable_legacy_table_migration = false` in the `[meta]` section of your `toml` file (requires meta node restart).
- **Limitations & Workaround**: You cannot create a new `sink-into-table` or drop an existing one on a table that has not completed migration. If the background migration is stuck or taking too long and you urgently need to perform these DDL operations, you can force a migration by running:
    ```
    ALTER TABLE {table_name} ADD COLUMN {col_name} int;
    ALTER TABLE {table_name} DROP COLUMN {col_name};
    ```
    After this, you can use it as a normal table.

<Update label="v1.6.0" description="2024-01-11">

## SQL features

*   Query syntax:
    *   Allows `NOW` in upper bound condition for temporal filters. [#13985](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13985).
    *   Supports temporal filters with multiple `OR` expressions. [#14382](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14382).
    *   Supports `<expr> [ NOT ] SIMILAR TO <pat> [ ESCAPE <esc_text> ]` clause. [#14000](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14000).
    *   **Breaking change**: Fixes the correctness of `SOME`, `ALL`, and `ANY` expressions. Drop and recreate any materialized views that use these expressions. [#14221](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14221).
    *   Supports array subquery and \\du command. [#14044](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14044).
    *   Supports `SET PARALLELISM` clause for `ALTER` commands. [#14240](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14240).
*   SQL commands:
    *   Technical preview feature: Supports `CREATE SINK INTO TABLE` Multiple sinks can use the same table as the destination. [#13185](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13185), [#13659](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13659).
*   SQL functions & operators:
    *   **Breaking change**: `0b10` is now interpreted as binary `10` instead of `0 as b10`. Integer literals can be given in hex `0x`, oct `0o`, and bin `0b`. [#14262](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14262).
    *   Supports interval type as input for `to_char()`. [#14071](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14071).
    *   Supports `NULL` and fraction expression as direct arguments of ordered-set aggregate functions. [#14080](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14080).
*   System catalog:
    *   Add system view `rw_streaming_parallelism`. [#14261](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14261).

## Connectors

*   Adds CDC backfill support for Postgres so users can ingest multiple PostgreSQL tables with a single replication slot. [#13958](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13958).
*   Support multi-table transactions from upstream MySQL & Postgres CDC. Specify `transactional = true` in the `WITH` options to enable it. [#14375](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14375).
*   Renames `scan.startup.timestamp_millis` to `scan.startup.timestamp.millis` for Kafka, Pulsar, and NATS source. [#13656](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13656).

*   For Elasticsearch sinks, the default es.type is set as `_doc` for Elasticsearch 6.x and 7.x, and is removed in Elasticsearch 8.x. RisingWave's Elasticsearch sink will now send JSONB as a JSON string, and Elasticsearch will convert it into an object. [#14273](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14273).
*   `connector = 'iceberg_java'` is deprecated, and users can only Iceberg sinks with the Rust version of Iceberg. Similarly, the DeltaLake sink will also use the Rust version implementation. [#14277](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/14277).
*   Supports StarRocks sink. [#12681](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/12681).

## Installation and deployment

</Update>

<Update label="v1.5.0" description="2023-12-11">

## SQL features

*   SQL Commands:
    *   Supports `SET SCHEMA` syntax for `ALTER {TABLE t | [MATERIALIZED] VIEW (m)v | SOURCE src | SINK sink | CONNECTION c | FUNCTION f( argument_type [, ...] )}`. [#13341](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13341).
    *   Supports `OWNER TO` syntax for ALTER DATABASE | SCHEMA | TABLE | \[MATERIALIZED\] VIEW | SOURCE | SINK. [#13216](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13216).
    *   Supports `RENAME TO` syntax for `ALTER { DATABASE db | SCHEMA s}`. [#13713](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13713).
    *   Supports `KILL` command. [#13434](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13434)
    *   Supports `SHOW PROCESSLIST` command. [#13287](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13287).

    *   Supports `jsonb_build_array` and `jsonb_build_object`. [#13198](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13198).
    *   Supports `to_jsonb`. [#13161](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13161).
    *   Supports JSON path operators and functions. [#13568](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13568).
    *   Supports array operators `@>` and `<@`. [#13253](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13253).
    *   Fixes the correctness of case expressions. Previously if there were multiple matching values, the last one would match. [#13890](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13890). **The fix introduces a breaking change**. It is recommended to drop and recreate any materialized views that contain `CASE` expressions. If your instance enters a crash-loop, we suggest upgrading to v1.5.2, and dropping the corresponding materialized view that contains `CASE` expressions.
*   System catalog
    *   Adds columns `rw_version`, `total_memory_bytes`, `total_cpu_cores`, and `started_at`, and all nodes in system table `rw_worker_nodes`. [#13487](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13487).

*   Adds option `[properties.fetch.queue.backoff.ms](http://properties.fetch.queue.backoff.ms)` for Kafka source. [#13321](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13321).
*   Supports creating multiple CDC tables that share the same source, which allows for incremental and lock-free snapshot loading. [#12535](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/12535).
*   `CREATE SINK` statements no longer need to wait for backfill to complete. [#13665](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13665)

## Deployment

*   Adds a docker-compose file for standalone mode. [#13233](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/13233).

</Update>

<Update label="v1.1.0" description="2023-08-08">

## SQL features

*   SQL commands:

    *   `DROP` commands now support the `CASCADE` option, which drops the specified item and all its dependencies. [#11250](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11250)

    *   `CREATE TABLE` now supports the `APPEND ONLY` clause, allowing the definition of watermark columns on the table. [#11233](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11233)

    *   Supports new commands `START TRANSACTION`, `BEGIN`, and `COMMIT` for read-only transactions. [#10735](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10735)

    *   Supports `SHOW CLUSTER` to show the details of your RisingWave cluster, including the address of the cluster, its state, the parallel units it is using, and whether it's streaming data, serving data, or unschedulable. [#10656](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10656), [#10932](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10932)

*   SQL functions:

    *   Supports new window functions: `lead()` and `lag()`. [#10915](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10915)

    *   Supports new aggregate functions: `first_value()` and `last_value()`, which retrieve the first and last values within a specific ordering from a set of rows. [#10740](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10740)

    *   Supports the `grouping()` function to determine if a column or expression in the `GROUP BY` clause is part of the current grouping set or not. [#11006](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11006)

    *   Supports the `set_config()` system administration function. [#11147](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11147)

    *   Supports the `sign()` mathematical function. [#10819](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10819)

    *   Supports `string_agg()` with `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY`, enabling advanced string concatenation with distinct values and custom sorting. [#10864](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10864)

    *   Supports the co-existence of `string_agg()` and other aggregations with `DISTINCT`. [#10864](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10864)

    *   Supports the `zone_string` parameter in the `date_trunc()`, `extract()`, and `date_part()` functions, ensuring compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#10480](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10480)

        *   **Breaking change**: Previously, when the input for `date_trunc` was actually a date, the function would cast it to a timestamp and record the choice in the query plan. However, after this release, new query plans will cast the input to `timestamptz` instead. As a result, some old SQL queries, especially those saved as views, may fail to bind correctly and require type adjustments. It's important to note that old query plans will continue working because the casting choice is recorded with a cast to timestamp.

            Before this release:

            ```sql
                SELECT date_trunc('month', date '2023-03-04');

                        date_trunc
                ---------------------------
                2023-03-01 00:00:00
                (1 row)
            ```

            After this release:

            ```sql
            SELECT date_trunc('month', date '2023-03-04');

                    date_trunc
            ---------------------------
            2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00
            (1 row)
            ```

            Now, the result of `date_trunc` includes the timezone offset (`+00:00`) in the output, making it consistent with the behavior in PostgreSQL.

    *   `round()` now accepts a negative value and rounds it to the left of the decimal point. [#10961](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10961)

    *   `to_timestamp()` now returns `timestamptz`. [#11018](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11018)

*   Query clauses

    *   `SELECT` now supports the `EXCEPT` clause which excludes specific columns from the result set. [#10438](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10438), [#10723](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10723)

    *   `SELECT` now supports the `GROUPING SETS` clause which allows users to perform aggregations on multiple levels of grouping within a single query. [#10807](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10807)

    *   Supports index selection for temporal joins. [#11019](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11019)

    *   Supports `CUBE` in group-by clauses to generate multiple grouping sets. [#11262](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11262)

*   Patterns

    *   Supports multiple rank function calls in TopN by group. [#11149](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11149)
*   System catalog

    *   Supports querying `created_at` and `initialized_at` from RisingWave relations such as sources, sinks, and tables in RisingWave catalogs. [#11199](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11199)

## Connectors

*   Supports specifying more Kafka parameters when creating a source or sink. [#11203](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11203)

*   JDBC sinks used for upserts must specify the downstream primary key via the `primary_key` option. [#11042](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11042)

*   `access_key` and its corresponding `secret_key` are now mandatory for all AWS authentication components. [#11120](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/11120)

## Connectors

*   _**Breaking change**_: When creating a source or table with a connector whose schema is auto-resolved from an external format file, the syntax for defining primary keys within column definitions is replaced with the table constraint syntax. [#10195](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10195)

    ```sql Old
        CREATE TABLE debezium_non_compact (order_id int PRIMARY KEY) WITH (
        connector = 'kafka',
        kafka.topic = 'debezium_non_compact_avro_json',
        kafka.brokers = 'message_queue:29092',
        kafka.scan.startup.mode = 'earliest'
        ) ROW FORMAT DEBEZIUM_AVRO ROW SCHEMA LOCATION CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://message_queue:8081';
    ```

    ```sql New
    CREATE TABLE debezium_non_compact (PRIMARY KEY(order_id)) WITH ( ...
    ```

*   _**Breaking change**_: Modifies the syntax for specifying data and encoding formats for a source in `CREATE SOURCE` and `CREATE TABLE` commands. For v1.0.0, the old syntax is still accepted but will be deprecated in the next release. [#10768](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/10768)

    Old syntax - part 1:

    ```bash
    ROW FORMAT data_format
    [ MESSAGE 'message' ]
    [ ROW SCHEMA LOCATION ['location' | CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'schema_registry_url' ] ];
    ```

    New syntax - part 1:

    ```sql
    FORMAT data_format ENCODE data_encode (
    message = 'message',
    schema.location = 'location' | schema.registry = 'schema_registry_url'
    );
    ```

    Old syntax - part 2:

    ```sql
    ROW FORMAT csv WITHOUT HEADER DELIMITED BY ',';
    ```

    New syntax - part 2:

    ```bash
    FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE CSV (
    without_header = 'true',
    delimiter = ','
