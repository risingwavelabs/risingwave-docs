This page provides a high-level overview of how RisingWave versions are numbered, how frequently releases occur, and how long different versions are supported. It serves as a central point for understanding the overall release and support process.

## Versioning scheme (semantic versioning)

RisingWave adheres to the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) standard, using a three-part numbering system: `Major.Minor.Patch`.

*   **Major version (e.g., 2.0.0):** Represents significant releases with substantial new features, architectural changes, and potentially breaking changes that might require migration.
*   **Minor version (e.g., 2.1.0):** Represents regular releases with new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Minor versions are generally backward compatible within the same major version.
*   **Patch version (e.g., 2.1.1):** Represents releases focused solely on bug fixes and security patches. Patch versions do not introduce new features or breaking changes.


## Release cadence

RisingWave aims for a predictable release schedule:

*   **Major versions:** Typically released annually.
*   **Minor versions:** Typically released every 45 days.
*   **Patch versions:** Released as needed to address bugs and security vulnerabilities.

## Support duration (overview)

RisingWave provides support for released versions for a defined period.  This support includes bug fixes, security patches, and technical assistance.

*   **Major versions:** Supported for a period after the release of the subsequent major version.
*   **Minor versions:** Supported for a minimum of four months, or until three newer minor versions are released (whichever is longer).

**For detailed information on version support timelines, backporting of fixes, exception handling, and the complete deprecation process, please see the [RisingWave version deprecation policy](/changelog/version-deprecation).**

## Feature lifecycle

In addition to the software version lifecycle, individual features within RisingWave also have their own lifecycle (Technical preview, Public preview, General availability).

**For details on the feature lifecycle and how individual features are deprecated, please see the [RisingWave feature lifecycle and deprecation](/changelog/product-lifecycle).**
