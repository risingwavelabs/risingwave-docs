This document describes the versioning scheme and deprecation policy for RisingWave Database software. It explains the support lifecycle for RisingWave versions, helping users of RisingWave Cloud and the on-premises Premium edition plan upgrades. The policy provides a predictable framework for when support for older versions ends.

This document describes the deprecation policy for *RisingWave software versions*. For information on the lifecycle and deprecation of *individual features*, see the [RisingWave feature lifecycle and deprecation](/changelog/product-lifecycle).

## 1. Software versioning model (Semantic Versioning)

RisingWave adheres to the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) scheme, using a three-digit numbering system: `Major.Minor.Patch`. Understanding this scheme is crucial for interpreting the deprecation policy.

*   **Major version (e.g., 2.0.0):**  Represents significant, milestone releases. These releases often introduce substantial new features, architectural changes, and *may include breaking changes*. Breaking changes might require data migration or adjustments to user workflows.  Major versions are typically released annually.

*   **Minor version (e.g., 2.1.0):**  Represents regular, ongoing releases that deliver new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.  Minor versions are designed to be *backward compatible* within the same major version. This means that upgrading from, for example, 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 should not break existing functionality unless explicitly communicated.  Minor versions are typically released every 45 days.

*   **Patch version (e.g., 2.1.1):**  Represents releases focused solely on bug fixes and security patches. Patch versions do not introduce new features or breaking changes.  Multiple patch versions may be released within a single minor version's lifecycle.


## 2. Version deprecation policy

This section defines the rules for discontinuing support for older RisingWave versions. Support includes providing bug fixes, security patches, and technical assistance.

*   **2.1 Major version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a major version ceases 4 months *after* the release of the subsequent major version.

    *   **Example:** If RisingWave 3.0.0 is released on September 1st, 2024, then support for all 2.x.x versions (e.g., 2.10.5, 2.9.1, 2.0.0) will end on January 1st, 2025.  This provides a four-month window for users to migrate to the new major version.

*   **2.2 Minor version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a minor version continues for a minimum of 2.5 months, *or* until three newer minor versions have been released, *whichever period is longer*.

    *   **Example 1 (Minimum duration applies):** Version `2.1.0` is released on January 1st. The next three minor versions (`2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`) are released quickly, by March 1st (less than 2.5 months later). Because the 2.5-month minimum duration is longer than the time it took to release three newer versions, support for `2.1.0` continues until March 15th (2.5 months after its January 1st release).

    *   **Example 2 (Three newer versions apply):** Version `2.1.0` is released on January 1st, 2025. Versions `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, and `2.4.0` are released on February 15th, March 30th, and May 15th, respectively. Support for `2.1.0` ends on May 15th, 2025 (when `2.4.0` is released), as this is *longer* than the 2.5-month minimum.

*   **2.3 Cherry-picking fixes (backporting):**

    *   Critical bug fixes and security patches will be backported to a limited set of supported versions. This ensures that even users who haven't yet upgraded to the very latest release receive essential updates. Fixes will be applied to:
        *   The latest released minor version.
        *   The minor version currently undergoing release testing.
        *   *Potentially*, one past major version, subject to the major version deprecation policy (section 2.1). This is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

    *   **Example:** On March 5th, 2025, assume the following:
        *   Version 2.3.0 is undergoing release testing.
        *   Version 2.2.0 is the latest released version.
        *   Version 1.10.0 is an older major version, still within its support window.

        In this scenario, fixes would be backported to 2.3.0, 2.2.0, and *potentially* 1.10.0 (if it's still within the four-month grace period after the release of 2.0.0). Backporting to 2.1.0 would likely *not* occur, as it's superseded by two newer minor versions.

*   **2.4 Exceptions:**

    *   In exceptional circumstances, such as the discovery of critical security vulnerabilities, severe performance issues, or legal requirements, a version may be deprecated and removed with *shorter notice* than outlined above. RisingWave will make every effort to inform users as soon as possible in such cases.

## 3. RisingWave Cloud specifics

*   RisingWave Cloud users will receive notifications about version deprecation directly through the cloud portal.
*   The deprecation process will be automated using published maintenance windows for each region.  Details on this automation will be provided when the feature is available.
*   Until automation is in place, the RisingWave Cloud SRE team will coordinate with customers to ensure adherence to the version deprecation policy.

## 4. Communication and user support

*   **4.1 Communication channels:** RisingWave provides clear and timely communication about version deprecation through the following channels:
    *   Product release newsletter
    *   Blog posts
    *   Release notes
    *   Direct emails (to users of affected versions)
    *   In-product notifications (RisingWave Cloud interface)

*   **4.2 Content of notifications:**  Deprecation notices will include:
    *   The specific release being deprecated (e.g., "RisingWave 1.5.x").
    *   A clear timeline, including the announcement date, the date when active feature development ceases, and the final deprecation date (when support ends).
    *   Guidance on migration paths and available resources.

*   **4.3 Advance notice:**
    *   RisingWave will provide at least *2 months'* notice before deprecating a *major* version. The exact timeline may be adjusted based on the scope and impact of the changes in the new major release.

*   **4.4 Migration support:**  Where applicable, RisingWave will provide tools, documentation, and support resources to assist users in migrating to newer, supported versions. This may include migration scripts, step-by-step guides, and dedicated support channels.

*   **4.5 Feedback mechanism:**  User feedback is highly valued during the deprecation process.  RisingWave encourages users to provide feedback and raise concerns through designated channels (e.g., forums, support tickets) to help improve the migration experience.
