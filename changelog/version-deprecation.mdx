This document outlines the versioning scheme and deprecation policy for RisingWave Database.  It serves as a guide for understanding the support lifecycle of different RisingWave versions, and is particularly relevant for users of both RisingWave Cloud and the on-premises Premium edition. The policy's primary goal is to provide a predictable framework for when older versions cease to be supported, allowing users to plan upgrades accordingly.

This document describes the deprecation policy for *RisingWave software versions*. For information on the lifecycle and deprecation of *individual features*, please see the [RisingWave feature lifecycle and deprecation](/changelog/product-lifecycle).

## 1. Software versioning model (semantic versioning)

RisingWave adheres to the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) scheme, using a three-digit numbering system: `Major.Minor.Patch`. Understanding this scheme is crucial for interpreting the deprecation policy.

*   **Major version (e.g., 2.0.0):**  Represents significant, milestone releases. These releases often introduce substantial new features, architectural changes, and *may include breaking changes*. Breaking changes might require data migration or adjustments to user workflows.  Major versions are typically released annually.

*   **Minor version (e.g., 2.1.0):**  Represents regular, ongoing releases that deliver new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.  Minor versions are designed to be *backward compatible* within the same major version. This means that upgrading from, for example, 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 should not break existing functionality unless explicitly communicated.  Minor versions are typically released every 45 days.

*   **Patch version (e.g., 2.1.1):**  Represents releases focused solely on bug fixes and security patches. Patch versions do not introduce new features or breaking changes.  Multiple patch versions may be released within a single minor version's lifecycle.


## 2. Version deprecation policy

This section defines the rules governing when support for older versions of RisingWave Database is discontinued.  "Support" in this context refers to providing bug fixes, security patches, and technical assistance.

*   **2.1 Major version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a major version ceases four (4) months *after* the release of the subsequent major version.

    *   **Example:** If RisingWave 3.0.0 is released on September 1st, 2024, then support for all 2.x.x versions (e.g., 2.10.5, 2.9.1, 2.0.0) will end on January 1st, 2025.  This provides a four-month window for users to migrate to the new major version.

*   **2.2 Minor version deprecation:**

    *   Support for a minor version continues for a minimum of two and half (2.5) months, *or* until three newer minor versions have been released, *whichever period is longer*.

    *   **Example 1 (Two-and-half-month minimum):**  If version 2.1.0 is released, and the next three minor versions (2.2.0, 2.3.0, 2.4.0) are released very quickly (e.g., within three months), support for 2.1.0 will still continue for the full four months.

    *   **Example 2 (Three newer versions):** If version 2.1.0 is released on January 1st, 2025, and versions 2.2.0, 2.3.0, and 2.4.0 are released on February 15th, March 30th, and May 15th, respectively, then support for 2.1.0 would end on May 15th, 2025 (when 2.4.0 is released), as this is *longer* than the two-and-half-month minimum.

*   **2.3 Cherry-picking fixes (backporting):**

    *   Critical bug fixes and security patches will be "cherry-picked" (backported) to a limited set of supported versions. This ensures that even users who haven't yet upgraded to the very latest release receive essential updates. Fixes will be applied to:
        *   The latest released minor version.
        *   The minor version currently undergoing release testing.
        *   *Potentially*, one past major version, subject to the major version deprecation policy (section 2.1). This is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

    *   **Example:** On March 5th, 2025, assume the following:
        *   Version 2.3.0 is undergoing release testing.
        *   Version 2.2.0 is the latest released version.
        *   Version 1.10.0 is an older major version, still within its support window.

        In this scenario, fixes would be backported to 2.3.0, 2.2.0, and *potentially* 1.10.0 (if it's still within the four-month grace period after the release of 2.0.0). Backporting to 2.1.0 would likely *not* occur, as it's superseded by two newer minor versions.
*   **2.4 Exceptions:**

    *   In exceptional circumstances, such as the discovery of critical security vulnerabilities, severe performance issues, or legal requirements, a version may be deprecated and removed with *shorter notice* than outlined above. RisingWave will make every effort to inform users as soon as possible in such cases.

## 3. RisingWave Cloud specifics

*   RisingWave Cloud users will receive notifications about version deprecation directly through the cloud portal.
*   The deprecation process will be automated using published maintenance windows for each region.  Details on this automation will be provided when the feature is available.
*   Until automation is in place, the RisingWave Cloud SRE team will coordinate with customers to ensure adherence to the version deprecation policy.

## 4. Communication and user support

*   **4.1 Communication channels:**  RisingWave is committed to providing clear and timely communication about version deprecation through the following channels:
    *   **Product release newsletter:**  Regular updates on supported versions and upcoming deprecations.
    *   **Blog posts:**  Detailed explanations and migration guidance.
    *   **Release notes:**  Specific changes and deprecation notices within each release.
    *   **Direct emails:**  Targeted notifications to users of affected versions.
    *   **In-product notifications:**  Alerts within the RisingWave Cloud interface.

*   **4.2 Content of notifications:**  Deprecation notices will include:
    *   The specific release being deprecated (e.g., "RisingWave 1.5.x").
    *   A clear timeline, including:
        *   The announcement date.
        *   The date when active feature development ceases.
        *   The final deprecation date (when support ends).
    *   Guidance on migration paths and available resources.

*   **4.3 Advance notice:**
    *   RisingWave will provide at least *two (2) months'* notice before deprecating a *major* version. The exact timeline may be adjusted based on the scope and impact of the changes in the new major release.

*   **4.4 Migration support:**  Where applicable, RisingWave will provide tools, documentation, and support resources to assist users in migrating to newer, supported versions. This may include migration scripts, step-by-step guides, and dedicated support channels.

*   **4.5 Feedback mechanism:**  User feedback is highly valued during the deprecation process.  RisingWave encourages users to provide feedback and raise concerns through designated channels (e.g., forums, support tickets) to help improve the migration experience.
