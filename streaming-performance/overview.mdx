The above diagram is a simple conceptual illustration that broadly encompasses the entire process of a record being consumed from the source, processed, and then sent to the sink and downstream systems. During this period, if any link encounters insufficient resources or sluggishness, it will be analyzed from different perspectives.

The chapter [Top-down Workload Analysis: Key Metrics and Backpressure](./top-down-workload-analysis.mdx) from a top-down perspective, introducing several key metrics related to RisingWave performance, as well as what exactly happens in a RisingWave cluster under high pressure with the backpressure mechanism

The chapter [Bottom-up Resource Analysis](./bottom-up-resource-analysis.mdx) from a bottom-up perspective, categorizing and discussing the impact caused by bottlenecks in different modules and resources. It starts from key metrics in different sub-components in RisingWave to identify the bottleneck and provide some action items that can potentially resolve the bottlenecks.
