title: "Streaming performance"
description: "Each streaming job, for example, a materialized view, is composed of multiple fragments that form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)."

## Overview

Each fragment consists of multiple parallel actors, and each actor is comprised of one or more streaming operators interconnected. The RisingWave Dashboard provides a visualization of the actor/fragment topology for active jobs in the Actor/Fragment panel.

Occasionally, a streaming actor or fragment can become a bottleneck within the overall streaming job. This guide aims to assist you in identifying the bottleneck and providing solutions to address this issue.

## Find out the back-pressured fragments

When an actor or fragment performs slower than others, it back-pressures its preceding actors/fragments. Thus, to find the root of backpressure, we need to find the frontmost actors/fragments in the DAG.

To accomplish this, refer to the Grafana dashboard and navigate to the "Streaming - Backpressure" panel. In the panel, find the channels with high backpressure and identify the frontmost one.

For example, in the image above, both `15002→15001` and `15003→15002` are high. Considering backpressure can be passed to preceding fragments, the root cause is probably `15001`.

To find out the corresponding part in your SQL query, refer to the RisingWave Dashboard and access the "Fragment" panel. Additionally, run `EXPLAIN CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW …` to see the query plan and find out the part corresponding to the problematic fragments.

## Improve the performance of streaming query
Some performance issues are caused by heavy SQL queries, such as:

* Heavy aggregations such as `array_agg`.
* Joins with unreasonable amplification.
* Union (which needs to deduplicate rows) instead of Union ALL.
* UDF performance issues.

For these scenarios, it would be beneficial to consider rewriting your queries to optimize their performance.
