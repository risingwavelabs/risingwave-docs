Use the `ALTER DATABASE` command to do the following operations on a database:

+ change the owner

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name 
    alter_option;
```

*`alter_option`* depends on the operation you want to perform on the database.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name
    OWNER TO new_user
```

## Change the owner

```sql title=Syntax
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name
    OWNER TO new_user;
```

:::note
To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and you must have the `CREATEDB` privilege. Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.
