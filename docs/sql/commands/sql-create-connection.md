Use the `CREATE CONNECTION` command to create an AWS PrivateLink connection for a Kafka source connector. This is necessary in order to be able to consume messages from a Kafka service located in a different VPC from the RisingWave cluster in the cloud.

For details on how to connect to a Kafka broker, see the [Ingest data from Kafka](/create-source/create-source-kafka.md) topic.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION [ IF NOT EXIST ] connection_name
WITH (
    connection_parameter = 'value'
);
```

## Parameters

|Parameter or clause            | Description           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
|*connection_name*              |The name of the connection to be created.|
|type                           |The type of connection.|
|provider                       |The provider of the connection.|
|service.name                   |The service name of the endpoint service.|
