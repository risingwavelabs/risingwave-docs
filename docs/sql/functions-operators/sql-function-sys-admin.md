<!--
## `pg_terminate_backend()`

Terminates a backend. You can execute this against another backend that has exactly the same role as the user calling the function. In all other cases, you must be a superuser. For more details, see [System Administration Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html).

## `pg_backend_pid()`

Returns the ID of the server process attached to the current session. For more details, see [System Information Functions and Operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-info.html).

## `pg_cancel_backend()`

Cancels a backend's current query. You can execute this against another backend that has exactly the same role as the user calling the function. In all other cases, you must be a superuser. For more details, see [System Administration Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html). -->
