## What are runtime parameters?

Runtime parameters are variables that can be set at runtime to configure the behavior of RisingWave.

## How to view runtime parameters?

You can use the `SHOW ALL` command to view the runtime parameters, their current settings, and some notes about these parameters.

```sql
SHOW ALL;
```

For example, you may see a table similar to this:


```plain text title="Runtime Parameters"
          Name                  |     Setting     |        Description
--------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------
 rw_implicit_flush              | false           | If `RW_IMPLICIT_FLUSH` is on, then every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement will block until the entire dataflow is refreshed.
 create_compaction_group_for_mv | false           | If `CREATE_COMPACTION_GROUP_FOR_MV` is on, dedicated compaction groups will be created in MV creation.
 query_mode                     | auto            | A temporary config variable to force query running in either local or distributed mode. If the value is auto, the system will decide for you automatically.
 ...
```

Below is the detailed information about the parameters you may see after using the `SHOW ALL` command:

|                 Name                  |     Values or value examples     |                                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| bytea_output                          | `hex`           | Set the output format for values of type bytea. Valid values are hex (the default) and escape (the traditional PostgreSQL format). See Section 8.4 for more information. The bytea type always accepts both formats on input, regardless of this setting. |


If you just want to view a specific parameter's value, you can also use the `SHOW` command.

```sql
SHOW parameter_name;
```

## How to configure runtime parameters?

You can use `SET` command or the `set_config()` function to change the setting of a runtime parameter.

The syntax of the `SET` command is:

```sql
SET parameter_name { TO | = } { value | 'value' | DEFAULT};
```

Where `parameter_name` is the name of the parameter, and `value` or `'value'` is the new value of the parameter. `DEFAULT` can be written to specify resetting the parameter to its default value.

For details about the `set_config()` function, see [System administration functions](/sql/functions-operators/sql-function-sys-admin.md#set_config), and for details about the `SET` command, see [`SET`](/sql/commands/sql-set.md).
