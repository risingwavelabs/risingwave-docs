RisingWave supports delivering data to downstream systems via its sink connectors.

To stream data out of RisingWave, you must create a sink. A sink is an external target that you can send data to. Use the [`CREATE SINK`](/sql/commands/sql-create-sink.md) statement to create a sink. You need to specify what data to be exported, the format, and the sink parameters.

Sinks become visible right after you create them, regardless of the backfilling status. Therefore, it's important to understand that the data in the sinks may not immediately reflect the latest state of their upstream sources due to the latency of the sink, connector, and backfilling process.
To determine whether the process is complete and the data in the sink is consistent, refer to [Monitor statement progress](/manage/view-statement-progress.md).

Currently, RisingWave supports the following sink connectors:

- Apache Doris sink connector (`connector = 'doris'`)
  
  With this connector, you can sink data from RisingWave to Apache Doris. For details about the syntax and parameters, see [Sink data to Apache Doris](/guides/sink-to-doris.md).

## Sink decoupling

Typically, sinks in RisingWave operate in a blocking manner. This means that if the downstream target system experiences performance fluctuations or becomes unavailable, it can potentially impact the stability of the RisingWave instance. However, sink decoupling can be implemented to address this issue.

Sink decoupling introduces a buffering queue between a RisingWave sink and the downstream system. This buffering mechanism helps maintain the stability and performance of the RisingWave instance, even when the downstream system is temporarily slow or unavailable.

The `sink_decouple` session variable can be specified to enable or disable sink decoupling. The default value for the session variable is `default`. 

To enable sink decoupling for all sinks created in the sessions, set `sink_decouple` as `true` or `enable`.

```sql
SET sink_decouple = true;
```

To disable sink decoupling, set `sink_decouple` as `false` or `disable`, regardless of the default setting. 

```sql
SET sink_decouple = false;
```

Sink decoupling is enabled by default for **all sinks** in RisingWave.

An internal system table `rw_sink_decouple` is provided to query whether a created sink has enabled sink decoupling or not.

```sql
dev=> select sink_id, is_decouple from rw_sink_decouple;
 sink_id | is_decouple 
---------+-------------
       2 | f
       5 | t
(2 rows)

```

## Upsert sinks and primary keys

For each sink, you can specify the data format. The available data formats are `upsert`, `append-only`, and `debezium`. To determine which data format is supported by each sink connector, please refer to the detailed guide listed above.

In the `upsert` sink, a non-null value updates the last value for the same key or inserts a new value if the key doesn't exist. A NULL value indicates the deletion of the corresponding key.

When creating an `upsert` sink, note whether or not you need to specify the primary key in the following situations.

- If the downstream system supports primary keys and the table in the downstream system has a primary key, you must specify the primary key with the `primary_key` field when creating an upsert JDBC sink.

- If the downstream system supports primary keys but the table in the downstream system has no primary key, then RisingWave does not allow users to create an upsert sink. A primary key must be defined in the table in the downstream system.

- If the downstream system does not support primary keys, then users must define the primary key when creating an upsert sink.

## Sink data in parquet format

:::info Public Preview
This feature is in the public preview stage, meaning it's nearing the final product but is not yet fully stable. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please contact us through our [Slack channel](https://www.risingwave.com/slack). Your input is valuable in helping us improve the feature. For more information, see our [Public preview feature list](/product-lifecycle/#features-in-the-public-preview-stage).
:::

RisingWave supports sinking data in Parquet format to file systems including S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Azure Blob Storage. This eliminates the need for complex data lake setups. Once the data is saved, the files can be queried using the batch processing engine of RisingWave through the `file_scan` API. You can also leverage third-party OLAP query engines for further data processing.

Below is an example to sink data to S3:

```sql
CREATE SINK test_file_sink FROM test 
WITH (
    connector = 's3',
    s3.region_name = '{config['S3_REGION']}',
    s3.bucket_name = '{config['S3_BUCKET']}',
    s3.credentials.access = '{config['S3_ACCESS_KEY']}',
    s3.credentials.secret = '{config['S3_SECRET_KEY']}',
    s3.endpoint_url = 'https://{config['S3_ENDPOINT']}'
    s3.path = '',
    type = 'append-only',
    force_append_only='true'
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE PARQUET(force_append_only='true');  
```

:::note
File sink currently supports only append-only mode, so please change the query to `append-only` and specify this explicitly after the `FORMAT ... ENCODE ...` statement.
