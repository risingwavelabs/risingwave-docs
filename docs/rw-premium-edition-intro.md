This topic introduces the RisingWave Premium Edition and offers a complete list of all premium features.

## What is RisingWave Premium?

The RisingWave Premium Edition is a feature-rich paid offering built on top of the open-source RisingWave Community Edition that is available from RisingWave v2.0. Designed for enterprises and organizations with mission-critical data infrastructure needs, the Premium Edition provides a suite of enterprise-grade capabilities to help users maximize the benefits of their RisingWave deployments.

While the Premium Edition is a paid offering, it is designed to complement and enhance the open-source RisingWave Community Edition. The Community Edition will continue to be freely available under the Apache License (Version 2.0), and we remain committed to supporting the needs of our open-source community and ecosystem.

Both the RisingWave Community Edition and Premium Edition share the same underlying binary or container image. However, the Premium Edition features are only available to users who have purchased a license. This is managed by a dedicated license system maintained by the RisingWave team.
