This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to Snowflake using the Snowflake sink connector in RisingWave.

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that allows for scalable and efficient data storage and analysis. For more information about Snowflake, see [Snowflake official website](https://www.snowflake.com/en/). 

Sinking from RisingWave to Snowflake utilizes [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-apis) for data loading. Initially, data is staged in a user-managed S3 bucket in JSON format, and then loaded into the Snowflake table via Snowpipe.

## Prerequisite

- Ensure you have a S3 bucket that RisingWave can connect to.

- Ensure you have an upstream materialized view or source in RisingWave that you can sink data from.

- Ensure you have a RSA key-value pair for authentication, and set up the credential for the `Snowflake User`.

- Ensure you have a `Snowflake table` that you can sink data to. For additional guidance on creating a table and setting up Snowflake, refer to the [Getting started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started) guide of Snowflake documentation.

- Ensure you have a `Snowflake stage` that references the external Amazon S3 bucket. Snowflake will use this stage internally to load the data. Currently, only the JSON format is supported.

- Ensure you have a `Snowflake pipe` to receive the loaded data from the pre-defined stage and copy it to the Snowflake table.

:::note
RisingWave will not be responsible for deleting data already imported by S3. You can manually set the lifecycle configuration of your S3 bucket to clear out unnecessary data. See [Lifecycle configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html) and [Delete staged files](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-manage#deleting-staged-files-after-snowpipe-loads-the-datafor) for more details.

## Required permission

To successfully sink data into Snowflake, the S3 user account must have the appropriate permission:

- For the S3:  The user must have `WRITE` permission.

Meanwhile, the Snowflake user account must have the appropriate permissions:

- For the pipe: The user must have `OPERATE`permission.
- For the stage: The user must have `USAGE` and `READ` permission.
- For the table: The user must have `INSERT` and `SELECT` permission.
- For the database: The user must have `USAGE` permission.
- For the schema: The user must have `USAGE` permission.

## Syntax

Use the following syntax to create a sink in RisingWave:

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='snowflake',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Example

Here is an example on how you can sink data from RisingWave to Snowflake. For detailed data-pipelining and sinking logic, see [Overview of the Snowpipe REST endpoints to load data](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-overview).

### Set up S3

Set up an external S3 bucket and ensure you have the corresponding credentials. Both Snowflake stage and RisingWave sink creation require these credentials:

   - `snowflake.s3_bucket`: URL in Snowflake stage.
   - `snowflake.aws_access_key_id`: AWS_KEY_ID in Snowflake stage.
   - `snowflake.aws_secret_access_key`: AWS_SECRET_KEY in Snowflake stage.

### Set up Snowflake

   Next, you need to set up Snowflake, which involves the following steps:

   - Generate a key-value pair for authentication.
   - Create a `role` and grant the appropriate permissions.
   - Set up the credential for the user (e.g., `RSA_PUBLIC_KEY`) and retrieve `snowflake.rsa_public_key_fp` for later use in RisingWave.
   - Create a `table` to store the sink data from RisingWave.
   - Create a `stage` to reference the external S3 bucket, which Snowflake will use internally to load the data.
   - Create a `pipe` to receive the loaded data from the pre-defined stage and copy it to the Snowflake table.

This assumes that you have already created your accounts and corresponding databases in Snowflake. For detailed authentication processes, see [Authenticating to the server](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating); for detailed commands, see [Reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/reference). You can find an example of Snowflake setup commands in `snowflake_prep.sql`.

### Sink data

Now you can start sinking data. Launch your RisingWave cluster and execute the following SQL queries to create source and sink. See the examples below:

```sql title="Create source"
CREATE SOURCE s1_source (id int, name varchar)
WITH (
     connector = 'datagen',
     fields.id.kind = 'sequence',
     fields.id.start = '1',
     fields.id.end = '10000',
     fields.name.kind = 'random',
     fields.name.length = '10',
     datagen.rows.per.second = '200'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
 ```

```sql title="Create sink"
CREATE SINK snowflake_sink FROM ss_mv WITH (
    connector = 'snowflake',
    type = 'append-only',
    snowflake.database = 'EXAMPLE_DB',
    snowflake.schema = 'EXAMPLE_SCHEMA',
    snowflake.pipe = 'EXAMPLE_SNOWFLAKE_PIPE',
    snowflake.account_identifier = '<ORG_NAME>-<ACCOUNT_NAME>',
    snowflake.user = 'EXAMPLE_USER',
    snowflake.rsa_public_key_fp = 'EXAMPLE_FP',
    snowflake.private_key = 'EXAMPLE_PK',
    snowflake.s3_bucket = 'EXAMPLE_S3_BUCKET',
    snowflake.aws_access_key_id = 'EXAMPLE_AWS_ID',
    snowflake.aws_secret_access_key = 'EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY',
    snowflake.aws_region = 'EXAMPLE_REGION',
    snowflake.max_batch_row_num = '1030',
    snowflake.s3_path = 'EXAMPLE_S3_PATH',
);
 ```

### Sink data with upsert

Snowflake tables don't support direct updates. To handle this, RisingWave imports incremental logs and modification order for each data piece into Snowflake. You can then merge these as you read, or create dynamic tables to read the upsert results. See [How dynamic tables work](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) for more details.

Below are some examples for your reference.

```sql title="Create source in RisingWave"
CREATE SOURCE s1_source (id int,name varchar)
WITH (
    connector ='datagen',
    fields.id.kind ='sequence',
    fields.id.start ='1',
    fields.id.end ='10000',
    fields.name.kind ='random',
    fields.name.length ='10',
    datagen.rows.per.second ='200'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
 ```

```sql title="Create materialized view in RisingWave"
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ss_mv AS
WITH sub AS changelog FROM user_behaviors
SELECT
    user_id,
    target_id,
    event_timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'America/Indiana/Indianapolis' as event_timestamp,
    changelog_op AS __op,
    _changelog_row_id::bigint AS __row_id
FROM
    sub;
 ```
 
Note that RisingWave uses `changelog` to transform streaming data into incremental logs. In the example above, `changelog_op` represents the type of modification (Insert/Update/Delete), while `_changelog_row_id` indicates the order of the modification. See [AS CHANGELOG](/sql/commands/sql-as-changelog.md).

 ```sql title="Create sink in RisingWave"
CREATE SINK snowflake_sink FROM ss_mv WITH (
    connector ='snowflake',
    type ='append-only',
    snowflake.database ='EXAMPLE_DB',
    snowflake.schema ='EXAMPLE_SCHEMA',
    snowflake.pipe ='EXAMPLE_SNOWFLAKE_PIPE',
    snowflake.account_identifier ='<ORG_NAME>-<ACCOUNT_NAME>',
    snowflake.user ='EXAMPLE_USER',
    snowflake.rsa_public_key_fp ='EXAMPLE_FP',
    snowflake.private_key ='EXAMPLE_PK',
    snowflake.s3_bucket ='EXAMPLE_S3_BUCKET',
    snowflake.aws_access_key_id ='EXAMPLE_AWS_ID',
    snowflake.aws_secret_access_key ='EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY',
    snowflake.aws_region ='EXAMPLE_REGION',
    snowflake.max_batch_row_num ='1030',
    snowflake.s3_path ='EXAMPLE_S3_PATH',
);
 ```

 ```sql title="Create warehouse"
CREATE WAREHOUSE test_warehouse;
 ```

 ```sql title="Create dynamic table in Snowflake"
    CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE user_behaviors
    TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'
    WAREHOUSE = test_warehouse
    AS SELECT *
        FROM (
            SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY {primary_key} ORDER BY __row_id DESC) AS dedupe_id
            FROM t3
        ) AS subquery
    WHERE dedupe_id = 1 AND (__op = 1 or __op = 3);
 ```
