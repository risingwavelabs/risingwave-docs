This article describes adaptive parallelism as the default scaling policy for all new streaming jobs starting from v1.7 in RisingWave. With adaptive parallelism, the system will automatically adjust parallelism to leverage added CPU cores or nodes in the cluster, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

## Scaling policies

RisingWave supports adaptive and fixed parallelism for each streaming job, including materialized view, sink, and table.

- Adaptive parallelism

    Adaptive parallelism is the **default** setting for newly created streaming jobs since v1.7. In this mode, RisingWave automatically adjusts parallelism to utilize all CPU cores across the compute nodes in the cluster. When nodes are added or removed, parallelism adjusts accordingly based on the current number of CPU cores.

    To modify the scaling policy to adaptive parallelism, use the SQL command:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE t SET PARALLELISM = adaptive;
    ```

    To modify on a materialized view:

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv SET PARALLELISM = adaptive;
    ```

- Fixed parallelism

    Fixed parallelism is the advanced mode that allows manually specifying a parallelism number that remains constant as the cluster resizes. It’s commonly used to throttle stream bandwidth and ensures predictable resource allocation. For example:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE t SET PARALLELISM = 16; -- Replace 16 with the desired parallelism
    ```

    When there are many streaming jobs running in the cluster, it’s recommended to use fixed parallelism to avoid overloading the system.

RisingWave distributes its computation across lightweight threads called "streaming actors," which run simultaneously on CPU cores. By spreading these streaming actors across cores, RisingWave achieves parallel computation, resulting in improved performance, scalability, and throughput.

In both scaling modes, streaming actors will redistribute across the cluster to maintain balanced workloads.

## Scale-out

Scale-out here refers to the process of adding more **compute nodes** to the cluster. For frontend nodes, you can simply scale out/in by adding more frontend nodes to the cluster, because they are stateless and can be automatically discovered by the meta nodes.

1. First, add more compute nodes with `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    # If you are using risingwave-operator
    kubectl apply -f <file-with-more-replicas>.yaml # or kubectl edit RisingWave/<name>

    # If you are not using risingwave-operator
    kubectl scale statefulset/risingwave-compute --replicas=<number-of-replicas>
    ```

    Then wait until new compute nodes start.

2. If you are using fixed parallelism, you may need to manually adjust the parallelism of the streaming jobs to utilize the new compute nodes. For adaptive parallelism, the system will automatically adjust the parallelism to utilize the new compute nodes.

## Scale-in

Scale-in here refers to the process of decreasing **compute nodes** from the cluster. By default, there's a 5-minute delay in scale-in operations. The delay is intentional to prevent unnecessary heavy recovery operations caused by transient failures like network jitters and CPU stalls. To manually trigger immediate scale-in, use the following statement:

1. Run following commands to unregister a compute node.

    ```bash
    # Find out an worker id to unregister
    risingwave ctl meta cluster_info

    risingwave ctl meta unregister-worker {id}
    ```

    The `risingwave` command can be found at any node of the cluster. Recommend to use `kubectl exec` to login a pod and run the command. 

2. Decrease the number of compute nodes.

    ```bash
    # If you are using risingwave-operator
    kubectl apply -f <file-with-less-replicas>.yaml # or kubectl edit RisingWave/<name>

    # If you are not using risingwave-operator
    kubectl scale statefulset/risingwave-compute --replicas=<number-of-replicas>
    ```

3. If you are using fixed parallelism, you may need to manually adjust the parallelism of the streaming jobs. For adaptive parallelism, the system will automatically adjust the streaming jobs to use less parallelism.

## Upgrade to v1.7

After upgrading to v1.7 from prior versions, if the parallelism is unset, streaming jobs will automatically upgrade to adaptive parallelism (`adaptive`). If the parallelism is set, streaming jobs will use `fixed` parallelism.

## Monitor parallelism

You can use a system table to view the current scaling policy of tables, materialized views, and sinks:

```sql
dev=> SELECT * FROM rw_streaming_parallelism;
  id  | name |   relation_type   | parallelism
------+------+-------------------+-------------
 1001 | t    | table             | FIXED(4)
 1002 | mv1  | materialized view | AUTO
 1004 | idx  | index             | AUTO
(3 rows)
```

To view the parallelism of fragments within a specific streaming job, please use the system table `rw_fragment_parallelism` instead:

```sql
dev=> SELECT * FROM rw_fragment_parallelism WHERE name = 't';
  id  | name |   relation_type   | fragment_id | distribution_type | state_table_ids | upstream_fragment_ids |        flags        | parallelism
------+------+-------------------+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------
 1001 | t    | table             |           2 | HASH              | {}              | {}                    | {SOURCE,DML}        |           4
 1001 | t    | table             |           1 | HASH              | {1001}          | {2}                   | {MVIEW}             |           4
```

To understand the output of the query, you may need to know about these two concepts: [streaming actors](/concepts/key-concepts.md#streaming-actors) and [fragments](/concepts/key-concepts.md#fragments).
