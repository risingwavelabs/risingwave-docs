By default, credentials for connecting to external services (like MySQL) are specified in plain text within the `WITH` clause of `CREATE SOURCE / SINK` statements. This practice poses security risks, particularly for large organizations where multiple teams manage connected services.

To address the issue, we recommend using the `CREATE SECRET` command to store credentials securely. Admins can create secrets in advance, allowing other team members to reference them using secret identifiers when creating source/sink connections. This ensures that secrets remain protected throughout all phases of access.


RisingWave provides four key secret management operations:

- Creating secrets.

- Using secrets.

- Using secrets as a file.

- Dropping secrets.

In addition, you can use the [`rw_secrets`](/sql/system-catalogs/rw_catalog.md) catalog to view the ID, name, owner, and access control of secret objects.

## Create secrets

You can use the following statement to create secrets:

```sql title="Syntax for creating secrets"
CREATE SECRET secret_name WITH ( backend = 'meta') AS 'your_secret';
```

```sql title="Examples"
CREATE SECRET mysql_pwd WITH (
  backend = 'meta'
) AS '123';
```

:::note
Currently only the meta backend is supported.

## Use secrets

After creating secrets, you can use `SECRET your_secret_name` as the option value in the `WITH` clause. For example:

```sql title="Use a secret in the WITH clause"
CREATE SECRET mysql_pwd WITH (
  backend = 'meta'
) AS '123';

CREATE SOURCE mysql_source WITH (
connector = 'mysql-cdc',
hostname = 'localhost',
port = '8306',
username = 'rwcdc',
password = secret mysql_pwd,
database.name = 'test',
server.id = '5601'
);
```

## Use secrets as a file

Some connectors need credentials stored as file paths (e.g., `ssl.ca.location`), where the file contains the secret. RisingWave allows you to reference a secret as a file path.

```sql title="Reference a secret as a file path"
CREATE TABLE district (
    d_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (d_id)
) with (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'your-topic',
    properties.bootstrap.server = 'your-broker-address:29092',
    ssl.ca.location = SECRET kafka_ca AS FILE,
    ssl.certificate.location = SECRET kafka_cert AS FILE,
    ssl.key.location = SECRET kafka_key AS FILE,
    ssl.key.password = SECRET kafka_password,
) FORMAT DEBEZIUM ENCODE JSON;
```

## Drop secrets

You can use the following statement to drop secrets:

```sql title="Syntax for dropping secrets"
DROP SECRET secret_name;
```

## Examples

Here is an example. We create a secret named `mysql_pwd`, and then use it in the `WITH` clause. After that, we use the `SHOW CREATE SOURCE` command to view the password.

```sql
CREATE SECRET mysql_pwd WITH ( backend = 'meta' ) AS '123';
```

```sql
CREATE SOURCE mysql_source WITH (
 connector = 'mysql-cdc',
 hostname = 'localhost',
 port = '8306',
 username = 'rwcdc',
 password = secret mysql_pwd,
 database.name = 'test',
 server.id = '5601'
);
```

```sql
SHOW CREATE SOURCE mysql_source;

---RESULT
--- public.mysql_mydb | CREATE SOURCE mysql_mydb WITH (connector = 'mysql-cdc', hostname = 'mysql', port = '3306', username = 'root', password = secret mysql_pwd, database.name = 'mydb', server.id = '2') FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON
```

As shown in the result, the MySQL password is hidden, ensuring no secret leaks.

## Notes for open-source deployment

To use secret management, you need to set the environment variable `RW_SECRET_STORE_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX` to a hex representation of a 128-bit key (e.g. `0123456789abcdef`). This key is used to encrypt secrets in RisingWave. You **MUST NOT** lose this key, as it is required to decrypt secrets.

To specify the temporary secret file directory, set `RW_TEMP_SECRET_FILE_DIR`. This is only used with the `as file` option.
