## Before you report: Issue reproduction checklist

To help us triage and fix your issue efficiently, gather the following information before reporting:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Environment information" icon="server">
- **RisingWave version**: Output from `SELECT version();` or deployment details
- **Deployment method**: Kubernetes, Docker, binary, RisingWave Cloud
- **Operating system and architecture**: Linux/macOS/Windows, x86_64/ARM64
- **Cloud provider or infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premises
- **Cluster configuration**: Number of nodes, resource limits (CPU, memory)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SQL statements and queries" icon="code">
- **Complete SQL statements**: Include `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE SOURCE`, `CREATE SINK`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, and any relevant queries
- **Query patterns**: Read queries, write patterns, join operations
- **Data types and schema**: Full table definitions with column types
- **Sample data**: Minimal dataset that reproduces the issue (anonymized if needed)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connector and integration config" icon="plug">
- **Connector type**: Kafka, PostgreSQL CDC, MySQL CDC, S3, etc.
- **Connector configuration**: Connection parameters, authentication settings
- **Upstream/downstream system versions**: Kafka version, database version, etc.
- **Network topology**: VPC, security groups, firewall rules
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error messages and logs" icon="triangle-exclamation">
- **Complete error text**: Full stack traces and error messages
- **RisingWave logs**: Meta node, compute node, frontend node logs
- **Timestamp of the issue**: When did the problem occur?
- **Frequency**: Is it intermittent or consistent?
- **Recent changes**: Did you recently upgrade, change configuration, or deploy new code?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitoring and metrics" icon="chart-line">
- **Dashboard screenshots**: From RisingWave Dashboard or Grafana
- **Performance metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Backpressure indicators**: Fragment graphs showing bottlenecks
- **Query latency**: End-to-end latency measurements
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to create a minimal reproducible example

A minimal reproducible example helps us understand and fix your issue faster:

1. **Isolate the problem**: Remove unrelated code, tables, or configurations
2. **Simplify the schema**: Use the smallest schema that reproduces the issue
3. **Provide sample data**: Include `INSERT` statements or a small data file
4. **Document the steps**: List exact commands to reproduce from a clean state
5. **Specify expected vs. actual behavior**: What should happen versus what actually happens

### Example: Good issue report structure

```text
**Environment:**
- RisingWave version: 2.1.0
- Deployment: Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- Cluster: 3 compute nodes, 4 CPU / 8GB RAM each

**Issue:**
Materialized view refresh fails with "out of memory" error after 1 hour

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. CREATE SOURCE ...
2. CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...
3. Wait 1 hour
4. Observe OOM error in compute node logs

**Expected behavior:**
Materialized view should continuously refresh without memory issues

**Actual behavior:**
After ~1 hour, compute node crashes with OOM

**Logs:**
[Attach relevant log excerpts]

**Additional context:**
Issue started after upgrading from 2.0.5 to 2.1.0
```
