description: "Use RisingWave's built-in JDBC hosted catalog to create and manage internal Iceberg tables with zero external dependencies."
---

The JDBC hosted catalog is the simplest way to get started with internal Iceberg tables in RisingWave. It utilizes RisingWaveâ€™s internal PostgreSQL-compatible metastore to serve as a standard Iceberg JDBC catalog, removing the need for you to deploy or manage any external catalog services.

## How it works

When you create an internal Iceberg table using a connection with `hosted_catalog = true`, RisingWave automatically manages the Iceberg metadata within its own metastore.

- **JDBC endpoint**: The metastore exposes a JDBC endpoint that is compatible with the Iceberg JDBC catalog specification.
- **External access**: Because it uses a standard protocol, external query engines like Spark or Trino can connect to this endpoint to discover and query the Iceberg tables that RisingWave manages.

## Create and test your table

To use the JDBC hosted catalog, you create a `CONNECTION` with `hosted_catalog = true` and then create an internal Iceberg table.

### 1. Create a connection

Define a connection that specifies your object storage backend. This example uses AWS S3.

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION hosted_catalog_conn WITH (
    type = 'iceberg',
    warehouse.path = 's3://my-bucket/warehouse/',
    s3.region = 'us-west-2',
    s3.access.key = 'your-key',
    s3.secret.key = 'your-secret',
    hosted_catalog = true
);
```

For details on configuring other storage backends, see [Object storage configuration](/iceberg/object-storage).

### 2. Set the default connection

Set the default connection for your session to simplify table creation.

```sql
SET iceberg_engine_connection = 'public.hosted_catalog_conn';
```

### 3. Create and query the table

Create an internal Iceberg table and write data to it.

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE my_iceberg_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR
) ENGINE = iceberg;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO my_iceberg_table VALUES (1, 'alice'), (2, 'bob');
FLUSH;

-- Query the data
SELECT * FROM my_iceberg_table;
```
