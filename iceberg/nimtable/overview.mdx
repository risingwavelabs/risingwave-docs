---

Nimtable is a lightweight control plane for Apache Iceberg catalogs. It provides a browser UI and REST API to explore catalog metadata, inspect table layouts, and orchestrate routine maintenance by delegating work to compute engines like RisingWave or Spark. It also exposes a standards-compliant Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint that RisingWave can register as an external catalog. [Source](https://github.com/nimtable/nimtable/tree/main)

## What Nimtable does

- Browse catalogs, schemas, tables, partitions, snapshots, and manifests
- Visualize snapshot and file distribution to spot optimization opportunities
- Run quick SQL queries in the browser for metadata inspection
- Act as an Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint for engines including RisingWave
- Configure catalogs through the UI or a `config.yaml` file
- Support common catalog backends: REST, AWS Glue, S3 Tables, and JDBC/PostgreSQL

## How it fits with RisingWave

- Register Nimtable’s REST endpoint as an Iceberg catalog in RisingWave, then create sources, sinks, or connections against it
- Inspect Iceberg tables that RisingWave writes, including schema, snapshots, and file layout
- Plan maintenance flows (compaction, optimization) while continuing to use RisingWave for incremental writes and reads

## Architecture at a glance

- Web UI on port 3000 for interactive management
- REST Catalog API (default 8182) that fronts supported Iceberg catalog backends
- Metadata stored in PostgreSQL (configurable)
- Catalog definitions can be stored in Nimtable’s internal database (via UI) or provisioned via `config.yaml`

## When to use Nimtable

- You want a UI to explore and troubleshoot Iceberg tables produced or consumed by RisingWave
- You need a REST Catalog endpoint and prefer a managed control plane over standing up a catalog service yourself
- You want a single place to add catalogs and reuse them across RisingWave, Spark, or other engines

## Next steps

- [Get started with Nimtable](/iceberg/nimtable/get-started)
- If you plan to connect from RisingWave, review [REST catalog configuration](/iceberg/catalogs/rest) for the required `catalog.type` and `catalog.uri` settings
