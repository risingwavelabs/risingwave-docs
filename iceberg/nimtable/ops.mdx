## Ports and endpoints

- UI: 3000
- REST Catalog API: default 8182 (configurable in `config.yaml`)

## Configuration

- `config.yaml` mounted to `/app/config.yaml` in Docker for server, database, and catalog settings
- Environment variables for overrides (for example, admin username/password on first boot, AWS credentials)
- Keep secrets out of images; prefer mounted secrets or environment variables

## Metadata store

- Nimtable stores its own metadata in PostgreSQL; back up this database on your standard schedule
- UI-added catalogs persist in this database; file-based catalogs come from `config.yaml`

## Logging and observability

- Use `docker compose logs -f` for quick inspection
- Route container logs to your central log pipeline in production

## Security

- Change the default `admin/admin` credentials immediately after first login
- Limit network exposure of the REST endpoint and UI; place behind your standard auth and TLS termination
- Use least-privilege IAM for S3 or Glue access

## Backup and restore

- Back up the PostgreSQL database used by Nimtable
- Keep a versioned copy of `config.yaml` for reproducible deployments
