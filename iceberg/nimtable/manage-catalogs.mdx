## Templates and what they expect

- REST + S3  
  - Required: catalog type `rest`, REST URI, warehouse path (for example, `s3://warehouse/wh/`)  
  - S3 props: `io-impl`, `s3.endpoint`, `s3.access-key-id`, `s3.secret-access-key`, `s3.region`, `s3.path-style-access`
- JDBC + S3  
  - JDBC URI and credentials for the catalog store, S3 warehouse path and S3 props
- S3 Tables  
  - REST endpoint for S3 Tables, S3 region/signing settings, warehouse path, AWS credentials or IAM role
- Glue + S3  
  - Glue region and credentials or role, warehouse path, S3 props
- Custom  
  - Free-form key/value pairs for advanced or mixed setups
- Load from nimtable `config.yaml`  
  - Reads pre-provisioned catalogs from the mounted config file
- Load from Spark CLI parameters or `spark-defaults.conf`  
  - Reuses existing Spark Iceberg config to speed onboarding

## Where definitions live

- Catalogs added in the UI are stored in Nimtable’s internal database
- Catalogs in `config.yaml` are loaded at startup when mounted to `/app/config.yaml`

## AWS authentication options

- Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
- Mounted shared credentials file: `~/.aws/credentials` into the container
- IAM role assumption if supported by your environment (for example, Glue)

## Tips for RisingWave users

- Point RisingWave to the Nimtable REST endpoint using `catalog.type = 'rest'` and `catalog.uri`
- Keep storage credentials consistent between Nimtable and RisingWave or enable vended credentials if your REST catalog stack supports them
