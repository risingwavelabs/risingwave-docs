## What Nimtable tracks

- Tables needing compaction
- Recent compaction jobs and outcomes
- Watchlist entries for tables you want to track closely

## How to act

- Trigger compaction or optimization via your preferred engine (for example, Spark or a RisingWave job) while using Nimtable for visibility and coordination
- Use file and partition layout views to decide when to compact or rewrite manifests

## Using Nimtable as a REST Catalog for RisingWave

- Expose Nimtable’s REST endpoint to RisingWave and create Iceberg sources, sinks, or internal tables with `catalog.type = 'rest'`
- Keep storage credentials aligned or use vended credentials if your REST stack provides them

## Good practices

- Compact small files before downstream queries peak
- Monitor snapshots after large writes to ensure manifest counts stay healthy
- Pin critical tables to the watchlist to avoid missing compaction windows
