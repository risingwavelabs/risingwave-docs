You can sink data from RisingWave directly to a Databricks-managed Iceberg table using Unity Catalog. RisingWave acts as a streaming ETL engine, writing data directly into your Unity Catalog.

For a complete guide on configuring the full integration, see [Integrate with Databricks](/iceberg/integ-databricks).

<Note>
For a complete list of all catalog-related parameters, see the main [Catalog configuration](/iceberg/catalogs#catalog-parameters) page.
</Note>

## Example

To create a sink that writes to a Databricks Unity Catalog table, set `catalog.type` to `'rest'` with `vended_credentials = true` and provide your Unity Catalog REST endpoint and credentials. Note that currently, only `append-only` sinks are supported for this integration.

<Note>
`vended_credentials` is added in v2.7.0. For more information, see [Vended credentials](/iceberg/catalogs/rest#vended-credentials).
</Note>

```sql
CREATE SINK databricks_uc_sink FROM my_source
WITH (
  connector = 'iceberg',
  type = 'append-only',
  force_append_only = 'true',
  warehouse.path = '<your-uc-catalog-name>',
  database.name = '<your-schema-name>',
  table.name = '<your-table-name>',
  s3.region = 'ap-southeast-1',
  catalog.type = 'rest',
  vended_credentials = true,
  catalog.uri = 'https://<workspace-url>/api/2.1/unity-catalog/iceberg-rest',
  catalog.oauth2_server_uri = 'https://<workspace-url>/oidc/v1/token',
  catalog.credential= '<oauth_client_id>:<oauth_client_secret>',
  catalog.scope='all-apis'
);
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Internal tables (not supported)">
  Databricks Unity Catalog integration is intended for **Databricks-managed external Iceberg tables**.
  At the moment, RisingWave supports **writing via `CREATE SINK`** for this integration, but it is not intended for creating RisingWave-managed internal Iceberg tables via `ENGINE = iceberg`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Write (CREATE SINK)">
  The sink example above shows how to write to a Unity Catalog table.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Read (not supported)">
  Currently, this integration is documented for writing (sinking) only. To ingest Iceberg tables, use supported catalogs for `CREATE SOURCE`, such as Glue/REST/Hive, or see the general [Ingest data from Iceberg tables](/iceberg/ingest-from-iceberg) guide.
