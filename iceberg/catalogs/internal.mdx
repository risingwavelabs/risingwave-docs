---

RisingWave includes a built-in Iceberg catalog that simplifies the creation and management of internal Iceberg tables. It utilizes RisingWave’s internal PostgreSQL-compatible metastore to serve as a standard Iceberg JDBC catalog, removing the need for you to deploy or manage any external catalog services.

This is the simplest way to get started with internal Iceberg tables in RisingWave.

<Note>
You can use this catalog configuration when creating a `CONNECTION` for managing internal Iceberg tables.
</Note>

## How it works

When you create an internal Iceberg table using a connection with `hosted_catalog = true`, RisingWave automatically manages the Iceberg metadata within its own metastore.

- **JDBC endpoint**: The metastore exposes a JDBC endpoint that is compatible with the Iceberg JDBC catalog specification.
- **External access**: Because it uses a standard protocol, external query engines like Spark or Trino can connect to this endpoint to discover and query the Iceberg tables that RisingWave manages.

## Create and test your table

To use the built-in catalog, you create a `CONNECTION` with `hosted_catalog = true` and then create an internal Iceberg table.

### 1. Create a connection

Define a connection that specifies your object storage backend. This example uses AWS S3.

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION built_in_catalog_conn WITH (
    type = 'iceberg',
    warehouse.path = 's3://my-bucket/warehouse/',
    s3.region = 'us-west-2',
    s3.access.key = 'your-key',
    s3.secret.key = 'your-secret',
    hosted_catalog = true
);
```

For details on configuring other storage backends, see [Object storage configuration](/iceberg/object-storage).

### 2. Set the default connection

Set the default connection for your session to simplify table creation.

```sql
SET iceberg_engine_connection = 'public.built_in_catalog_conn';
```

### 3. Create and query the table

Create an internal Iceberg table and write data to it.

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE my_iceberg_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR
) ENGINE = iceberg;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO my_iceberg_table VALUES (1, 'alice'), (2, 'bob');
FLUSH;

-- Query the data
SELECT * FROM my_iceberg_table;
```
