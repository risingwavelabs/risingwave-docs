You can ingest data from Apache Iceberg tables managed by Snowflake. To do this, configure RisingWave to use Snowflake's built-in catalog.

Note that the Snowflake catalog can only be used for creating Iceberg sources.

<Note>
For a complete list of all catalog-related parameters, see the main [Catalog configuration](/iceberg/catalogs#catalog-parameters) page.

## Example

To create a source that reads from a Snowflake-managed Iceberg table, set `catalog.type` to `'snowflake'` and provide your Snowflake connection details.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE my_snowflake_source
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    catalog.type = 'snowflake',
    catalog.uri = 'jdbc:snowflake://<account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com/',
    catalog.jdbc.user = '<your_username>',
    catalog.jdbc.password = '<your_password>',
    warehouse.path = '<warehouse_path>',
    database.name = '<your_database>',
    table.name = '<your_table>'
);
```
