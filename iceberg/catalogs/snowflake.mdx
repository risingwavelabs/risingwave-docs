---

You can ingest data from Apache Iceberg tables managed by Snowflake. To do this, configure RisingWave to use Snowflake's built-in catalog.

Note that the Snowflake catalog can only be used for creating Iceberg sources.

<Note>
For a complete list of all catalog-related parameters, see the main [Catalog configuration](/iceberg/catalogs#catalog-parameters) page.
</Note>

## Example

Snowflake catalog is **read-only** in RisingWave and can only be used for **creating Iceberg sources** (`CREATE SOURCE`).

```sql
CREATE SOURCE my_snowflake_source
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',

    warehouse.path = '<warehouse_path>',
    database.name = '<your_database>',
    table.name = '<your_table>',

    catalog.type = 'snowflake',
    catalog.uri = 'jdbc:snowflake://<account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com/',
    catalog.jdbc.user = '<your_username>',
    catalog.jdbc.password = '<your_password>'
);
```

<Note>
Snowflake catalog does not support `CREATE CONNECTION` (internal Iceberg tables) or `CREATE SINK` in RisingWave.
