title: Interact with Iceberg
description: "Learn about different ways to use Iceberg with RisingWave"
---
Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic tables stored typically on object storage. RisingWave offers several ways to interact with tables using the Iceberg format, enabling you to leverage Iceberg's capabilities within your streaming pipelines.

It's important to understand that RisingWave's own internal storage system (Hummock) also commonly uses object storage (like S3) to persist data, but it does so using a row-based format optimized for RisingWave's internal operations.

When interacting with Iceberg, you are working with data stored in the columnar Iceberg format on object storage. RisingWave provides the following interaction methods:

- Read data from Iceberg tables managed externally: Use the native Iceberg source connector to ingest data into RisingWave from Iceberg tables that are created and managed outside of RisingWave (e.g., by Spark, Flink, or batch ETL jobs).

- Write data to Iceberg tables managed externally: Use the native Iceberg sink connector to stream processed results from RisingWave out to these externally managed Iceberg tables.

- Store data natively within RisingWave using the Iceberg format: Use the Iceberg table engine to create and manage tables directly within RisingWave, but store their data in the Iceberg format on configured object storage, using an Iceberg catalog.

This topic provides an overview of these methods.

## Read from externally managed Iceberg tables (Iceberg source)

You can create an Iceberg source in RisingWave to read data from an existing Iceberg table. These tables typically reside in object storage (like S3, HDFS) and their metadata/data lifecycle is managed by systems other than RisingWave. This allows you to ingest data from your existing data lake directly into RisingWave.

- Use case: Ingesting data into RisingWave from Iceberg tables populated by other batch or streaming systems.

- How: Use the `CREATE SOURCE` command with `connector = 'iceberg'`. You'll need to configure connection details for the Iceberg catalog and the underlying object storage. For details, see [Ingest data from Iceberg](/ingestion/sources/iceberg).

The following example demonstrates creating a source that reads from an Iceberg table stored on AWS S3:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE iceberg_source
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    type='append-only',
    warehouse.path = 's3://your-bucket/path/to/iceberg/warehouse',
    database.name = 'YOUR_ICEBERG_DB',
    table.name = 'YOUR_ICEBERG_TABLE',
    s3.endpoint = 'http://YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT:PORT', -- e.g., 'http://minio:9000'
    s3.access.key = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    s3.secret.key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    s3.region = 'YOUR_S3_REGION'  -- Optional if endpoint is specified
) ;
```

## Write to externally managed Iceberg tables (Iceberg sink)

You can create an Iceberg sink to stream data from RisingWave (e.g., from a table, source, or materialied view) into an Iceberg table that is managed externally. This is useful for exporting processed results to update a data lake built on Iceberg.

- Use case: Exporting processed streaming data from RisingWave to an existing data lake managed outside RisingWave.

- How: Use the `CREATE SINK` command with `connector = 'iceberg'`. You need to configure the Iceberg catalog and object storage connection details corresponding to the target external table.

```sql
CREATE SINK sink_demo_rest FROM t
WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    type = 'append-only',
    force_append_only = true,
    s3.endpoint = 'https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com',
    s3.region = 'ap-southeast-2',
    s3.access.key = 'xxxx',
    s3.secret.key = 'xxxx',
    s3.path.style.access = 'true',
    catalog.type = 'rest',
    catalog.uri = 'http://localhost:8181/api/catalog',
    warehouse.path = 'quickstart_catalog',
    database.name = 'ns',
    table.name = 't1',
    catalog.credential='123456:123456',
    catalog.scope='PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL',
    catalog.oauth2_server_uri='xxx'
    catalog.scope='xxx',
);
```

## Store data natively in Iceberg format (Iceberg table engine)

RisingWave can store data directly in the Apache Iceberg format using the Iceberg table engine, and manage them natively within RisingWave. This provides an alternative to RisingWave's default internal storage format.

When you create a table using `ENGINE = iceberg`, you are creating an Iceberg table. RisingWave manages the table's lifecycle, schema, and write operations, but persists the data according to the Iceberg specification on configured object storage, using a specified Iceberg catalog.

Tables created this way are standard Iceberg tables and can be read by other Iceberg-compatible engines (like Spark, Trino, Flink) using the same catalog and storage configuration, promoting interoperability.

This simplifies streaming pipelines where the final desired format is Iceberg and enables the data to be easily shared with other systems.

For complete instructions on setup, configuration options (like catalog types, commit intervals), features (like time travel), and limitations, see [Iceberg table engine](/store/iceberg-table-engine).
