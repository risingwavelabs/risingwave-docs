description: "Learn how to integrate Apache Iceberg with RisingWave to unify real-time data processing and data lake storage. Explore how to create and manage Iceberg tables in RisingWave, and how to connect RisingWave to Iceberg tables managed by external systems."
---
RisingWave supports two integration modes with Apache Iceberg: **RisingWave-managed Iceberg tables** (often called internal Iceberg tables in this documentation) and **externally managed Iceberg tables**.

In **RisingWave-managed Iceberg tables**, RisingWave manages the entire lifecycle of the Iceberg tables, including the catalog, compaction, and ingestion processes. RisingWave provides a PostgreSQL-compatible interface for accessing Iceberg data and ensures interoperability with all major query engines. This mode offers the simplest way to build a Medallion architecture.

In **externally managed Iceberg tables**, RisingWave connects to Iceberg tables managed by external systems. RisingWave can both read from and write to these tables, enabling seamless data exchange across different environments.

## RisingWave in a medallion architecture

RisingWave bridges **real-time streaming systems** with **Iceberg-based data lakes**.

It acts as the continuous **ingestion and transformation layer** in a Medallion architecture, where data flows from raw sources into refined, query-ready Iceberg tables through incremental computation and cascading materialized views.
