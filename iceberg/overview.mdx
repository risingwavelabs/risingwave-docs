description: "Learn how to interact with Apache Iceberg using RisingWave to unify real-time data processing and data lake storage. Explore how to create and manage Iceberg tables in RisingWave, and how to connect RisingWave to Iceberg tables managed by external systems."
---
RisingWave supports two interaction modes with Apache Iceberg: **internally managed Iceberg tables** (often called RisingWave-managed Iceberg tables) and **externally managed Iceberg tables**.

In [internally managed Iceberg tables](/iceberg/ov-internal), RisingWave manages the entire lifecycle of the Iceberg tables, including the catalog, compaction, and ingestion processes. RisingWave provides a PostgreSQL-compatible interface for accessing Iceberg data and ensures interoperability with all major query engines. This mode offers the simplest way to build a Medallion architecture.

In [externally managed Iceberg tables](/iceberg/ov-external), RisingWave connects to Iceberg tables managed by external systems. RisingWave can both read from and write to these tables, enabling seamless data exchange across different environments.

## RisingWave in a medallion architecture

RisingWave bridges **real-time streaming systems** with **Iceberg-based data lakes**.

It functions as the **continuous ingestion, transformation, and maintenance service** within a Medallion architecture, ensuring that data seamlessly transitions from raw sources to optimized, query-ready Iceberg tables through incremental computation and cascading materialized views.
