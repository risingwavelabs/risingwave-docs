---

This guide shows how to deploy RisingWave with Lakekeeper, a hosted REST catalog service. This setup enables you to create and manage internal Iceberg tables that use a REST-compliant catalog.

You can deploy this configuration using one of two methods:

- **Docker**: Use this method for local testing and development.
- **Kubernetes (Helm)**: Use this method for production or clustered environments.

## Deploy with Docker

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed and running in your environment.
2. Clone the [RisingWave repository](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the `docker` directory within the repository.
   ```bash
   cd risingwave/docker
   ```
4. Run the `docker compose` command to start the services. This command deploys a RisingWave cluster and the Lakekeeper catalog. A default warehouse named `risingwave-warehouse` is automatically created. You can view its configuration at `http://localhost:8181/ui/warehouse` after the services are running.
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-with-lakekeeper.yml up
   ```
5. Connect to RisingWave to begin creating tables:
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -p 4566 -d dev -U root
   ```

### Steps

1. Create an Iceberg connection.
   ```sql
   CREATE CONNECTION lakekeeper_catalog_conn
   WITH (
       type = 'iceberg',
       catalog.type = 'rest',
       catalog.uri = 'http://lakekeeper:8181/catalog/',
       warehouse.path = 'risingwave-warehouse',
       s3.access.key = 'hummockadmin',
       s3.secret.key = 'hummockadmin',
       s3.path.style.access = 'true',
       s3.endpoint = 'http://minio-0:9301',
       s3.region = 'us-east-1'
   );
   ```

2. Set the connection as the default for your session.
   ```sql
   SET iceberg_engine_connection = 'public.lakekeeper_catalog_conn';
   ALTER SYSTEM SET iceberg_engine_connection = 'public.lakekeeper_catalog_conn';
   ```

3. Create an internal Iceberg table.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t_lakekeeper_basic(
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR,
       v BIGINT
   )
   WITH (commit_checkpoint_interval = 1)
   ENGINE = iceberg;
   ```

4. Insert data into the table.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO t_lakekeeper_basic VALUES
       (1, 'alice', 100),
       (2, 'bob', 200),
       (3, 'charlie', 300);
   FLUSH;
   ```

5. Query the table to verify the data.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM t_lakekeeper_basic;
   ```

## Deploy with Kubernetes (Helm)

### Prerequisites

Ensure your Kubernetes environment is configured with Helm by following the [installation instructions](/deploy/risingwave-k8s-helm).

### Steps

1. Add the RisingWave and Lakekeeper Helm repositories.
   ```bash
   helm repo add risingwavelabs https://risingwavelabs.github.io/helm-charts/ --force-update
   helm repo add lakekeeper https://lakekeeper.github.io/lakekeeper-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the deployment.
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace risingwave
   ```

3. Use Helm to install RisingWave with its bundled components.
   ```bash
   helm install -n risingwave --set tags.bundle=true risingwavelabs/risingwave
   ```

4. Use Helm to install Lakekeeper.
   ```bash
   helm install -n risingwave my-lakekeeper lakekeeper/lakekeeper
   ```

5. Verify that all pods are running successfully.
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n risingwave
   ```

6. Retrieve the default root password for the MinIO service.
   ```bash
   k get secret risingwave-minio -o jsonpath="{.data['root-password']}" | base64 -d
   ```

7. Forward the necessary ports. Run each command in a separate terminal.
   ```bash
   kubectl -n risingwave port-forward svc/risingwave 4567
   kubectl -n risingwave port-forward svc/risingwave-minio 9001
   kubectl -n risingwave port-forward svc/my-lakekeeper 8181
   ```

8. Configure the storage warehouse in the Lakekeeper UI.
   <Note>
   This guide uses **MinIO** as an example. If you use a different object store, such as **Amazon S3**, configure it accordingly in the Lakekeeper UI.
   </Note>

   Open `http://localhost:9001` in a browser and create a bucket (e.g., "abc"). Then, open `http://localhost:8181` and create a warehouse (e.g., "abc"), providing the following details:
    - **Access key**: `root`
    - **Password**: Use the password you obtained in the previous step.
    - **Path style**: Enable this toggle.
    - **Region**: `us-east-1`

9. Connect to RisingWave and run the test queries.
   ```bash Connect to RisingWave
   psql -h localhost -p 4567 -d dev -U root
   ```
   ```sql Run SQL
   create connection lakekeeper_catalog_conn
   with (
       type = 'iceberg',
       catalog.type = 'rest',
       catalog.uri = 'http://my-lakekeeper:8181/catalog/',
       warehouse.path = 'abc',       -- replace with your warehouse name
       s3.access.key = 'root',
       s3.secret.key = 'K9xXOGgEHx', -- replace with your MinIO secret key
       s3.path.style.access = 'true',
       s3.endpoint = 'http://risingwave-minio:9000',
       s3.region = 'us-east-1'
   );

   set iceberg_engine_connection = 'public.lakekeeper_catalog_conn';

   create table t_lakekeeper_basic(id int primary key, name varchar, v bigint)
   with(commit_checkpoint_interval = 1) engine = iceberg;

   insert into t_lakekeeper_basic values(1, 'alice', 100), (2, 'bob', 200), (3, 'charlie', 300);
   flush;

   select * from t_lakekeeper_basic;
   ```
