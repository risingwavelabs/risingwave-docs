description: "Configure the catalog for your Apache Iceberg sources, sinks, and internal tables in RisingWave."
---

When creating an Iceberg source, sink, or internal table, you must configure a catalog. The catalog is responsible for managing the table's metadata, including its schema, partitioning strategy, and data file locations.

RisingWave supports two main types of catalogs: a **built-in catalog** which is managed by RisingWave, and **external catalogs**, which you manage.

## Built-in catalog

The built-in catalog is a service managed by RisingWave that simplifies the setup for internal Iceberg tables by removing the need to manage an external catalog. This is the recommended approach for getting started.

## External catalogs

External catalogs are required when you need to connect to Iceberg tables that are managed by other systems. RisingWave supports several types of external catalogs.

## Catalog parameters

You specify the catalog configuration in the `WITH` clause of a `CREATE SOURCE`, `CREATE SINK`, or `CREATE CONNECTION` statement.

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `catalog.type` | The type of catalog. Supported values: `'storage'`, `'rest'`, `'rest_rust'`, `'hive'`, `'jdbc'`, `'glue'`, and `'snowflake'`. Defaults to `'storage'` if not specified. |
| `catalog.uri` | The URI for the catalog service. Required for `rest`, `hive`, `jdbc`, and `snowflake` catalog types. |
| `catalog.name` | A user-defined name for the catalog. Required for all types except `storage`. |
| `hosted_catalog` | Set to `true` when using the [Built-in catalog](/iceberg/catalogs/internal). |
| `catalog.jdbc.user` | Username for the JDBC catalog. |
| `catalog.jdbc.password` | Password for the JDBC catalog. |
| `catalog.credential` | Credentials for a REST catalog's OAuth2 flow. |
| `catalog.token` | A bearer token for a REST catalog. |
| `catalog.oauth2_server_uri` | The token endpoint URI for a REST catalog's OAuth2 flow. |
| `catalog.scope` | The OAuth2 scope for a REST catalog. |
| `catalog.rest.signing_region` | For Amazon S3 Tables: the AWS region for signing requests. |
| `catalog.rest.signing_name` | For Amazon S3 Tables: the service name for signing requests. |
| `catalog.rest.sigv4_enabled` | For Amazon S3 Tables: enables SigV4 signing. Must be `true`. |
| `glue.region` | The AWS region for the Glue catalog. |
| `glue.access.key` | The AWS access key ID for Glue authentication. If not specified, defaults to `s3.access.key`. |
| `glue.secret.key` | The AWS secret access key for Glue authentication. If not specified, defaults to `s3.secret.key`. |
| `glue.iam_role_arn` | The IAM role ARN to assume for Glue catalog access via STS. When set, the connector assumes the specified role for Glue catalog operations. |
| `enable_config_load` | If set to `true`, load warehouse credentials from environment variables. Only supported in self-hosted environments. |
| `vended_credentials` | Enable vended credentials for a REST catalog. When set to `true` with `catalog.type = 'rest'`, requests credentials from the REST catalog server instead of managing them directly. Default: `false`. |
