## Overview

Betting platforms, sports analysts, and market regulators benefit from analyzing and interpreting users' betting patterns.
For sports analysts, this data helps gauge fan sentiment and engagement, allowing them to identify high-profile events and fine-tune their marketing strategies.
Regulators, on the other hand, focus on ensuring fair play and compliance with gambling laws. They use these insights to prevent illegal activities, such as match-fixing or money laundering.

During live events, users’ behaviors can shift rapidly in response to gameplay developments.
Processing and analyzing these changes in real-time allows platforms to flag high-risk users, who may be more likely to engage in fraudulent activities.
By joining historic data on user behavior with live betting data, platforms can easily identify high-risk users for further investigation to mitigate potential risks.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to analyze users’ betting behaviors by integrating historical datasets with live data streams.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) interactive terminal, `psql`, is installed in your environment. For detailed instructions, see [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
* Install and run RisingWave. For detailed instructions on how to quickly get started, see the [Quick start](/get-started/quickstart/) guide.
* Ensure that a Python environment is set up and install the [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) library. 

## Step 1: Set up the data source tables

Once RisingWave is installed and deployed, run the three SQL queries below to set up the tables. You will insert data into these tables to simulate live data streams.

1. The table `user_profiles` table contains static information about each user.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
        user_id INT,
        username VARCHAR,
        preferred_league VARCHAR,
        avg_bet_size FLOAT,
        risk_tolerance VARCHAR
    );
    ```

2. The `betting_history` table contains historical betting records for each user.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE betting_history (
        user_id INT,
        position_id INT,
        bet_amount FLOAT,
        result VARCHAR,
        profit_loss FLOAT, 
        timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
    );
    ```

3. The `positions` table has real-time updates for ongoing betting positions for each user.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE positions (
        position_id INT,
        position_name VARCHAR,
        user_id INT,
        league VARCHAR,
        stake_amount FLOAT,
        expected_return FLOAT,
        current_odds FLOAT,
        profit_loss FLOAT,
        timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
    );
    ```

## Step 2: Run the data generator

To keep this demo simple, a Python script is used to generate and insert data into the tables created above. 

Clone the [awesome-stream-processing](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/awesome-stream-processing) repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/risingwavelabs/awesome-stream-processing.git
```

Navigate to the [user_betting_behavior](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/awesome-stream-processing/tree/main/02-simple-demos/sports_betting/user_betting_behavior) folder.

```bash
cd awesome-stream-processing/tree/main/02-simple-demos/sports_betting/user_betting_behavior
```

Run the `data_generator.py` file. This Python script utilizes the `psycopg2` library to establish a connection with RisingWave so you can generate and insert synthetic data into the tables `positions` and `market_data`. 

If you are not running RisingWave locally or using default credentials, update the connection parameters accordingly:

```python
default_params = {
    "dbname": "dev",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "4566"
}
```

## Step 3: Create materialized views

In this demo, you will create multiple materialized views to understand bettors' behavior trends.

Materialized views contain the results of a view expression and are stored in the RisingWave database. The results of a materialized view are computed incrementally and updated whenever new events arrive and do not require to be refreshed. When you query from a materialized view, it will return the most up-to-date computation results.

### Identify user betting patterns

The `user_betting_patterns` materialized view provides an overview of each user's betting history, including their win/loss count and average profit.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_betting_patterns AS
SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_bets,
    SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'Win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
    SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'Loss' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
    AVG(profit_loss) AS avg_profit_loss,
    SUM(profit_loss) AS total_profit_loss
FROM
    betting_history
GROUP BY
    user_id;
```

You can query from `user_betting_patterns` to see the results. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_betting_patterns LIMIT 5;
```

```
 user_id | total_bets | wins | losses |   avg_profit_loss   |  total_profit_loss  
---------+------------+------+--------+---------------------+---------------------
       6 |          4 |    3 |      1 |   52.34777393817115 |   209.3910957526846
       4 |          4 |    3 |      1 |    68.4942119081947 |   273.9768476327788
       2 |          4 |    0 |      4 | -123.37575449330379 | -493.50301797321515
       9 |          4 |    4 |      0 |  188.86010650028302 |   755.4404260011321
       3 |          4 |    1 |      3 |  -54.06198104612867 |  -216.2479241845147
```

### Summarize users' exposure

The `real_time_user_exposure` materialized view sums up the stake amounts of active positions for each user to track each user's current total exposure in real-time.

With this materialized view, you can filter for users who may be overexposed.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW real_time_user_exposure AS
SELECT
    user_id,
    SUM(stake_amount) AS total_exposure,
    COUNT(*) AS active_positions
FROM
    positions
GROUP BY
    user_id;
```

You can query from `real_time_user_exposure` to see the results. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM real_time_user_exposure LIMIT 5;
```
```
 user_id |   total_exposure   | active_positions 
---------+--------------------+------------------
       5 | 3784.6700000000005 |               12
       1 |            3779.05 |               12
      10 |            2818.66 |               12
       4 |            3275.99 |               12
       2 |            3220.93 |               12
```

### Flag high-risk users

The `high_risk_users` materialized view identifies high-risk users by analyzing their risk tolerance, exposure, and profit patterns. 

A user is considered high-risk if they meet all of the following criteria:
* The total exposure is five times greater than their average bet size. You can customize this threshold to be lower or higher.
* Their average profit loss is less than zero.

Some users who are not initially categorized as high-risk may exhibit behaviors that indicate they are high-risk users.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW high_risk_users AS
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.username,
    u.risk_tolerance,
    p.total_exposure,
    b.total_bets,
    b.avg_profit_loss,
    b.total_profit_loss
FROM
    user_profiles AS u
JOIN
    real_time_user_exposure AS p
ON
    u.user_id = p.user_id
JOIN
    user_betting_patterns AS b
ON
    u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE
    p.total_exposure > u.avg_bet_size * 5
    AND b.avg_profit_loss < 0;
```

You can query from `high_risk_users` to see the results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_risk_users;
```
```
 user_id | username | risk_tolerance |   total_exposure   | total_bets |   avg_profit_loss   |  total_profit_loss  
---------+----------+----------------+--------------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------
       2 | user_2   | Low            | 23341.270000000004 |         81 | -2.8318496459258133 | -229.37982131999087
```

When finished, press `Ctrl+C` to close the connection between RisingWave and `psycopg2`.
