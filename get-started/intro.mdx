## Unified platform for real-time data

RisingWave delivers a unified data platform that combines **ultra-low-latency stream processing** and **Iceberg-native data management**.

### Low-latency streaming processing and analytics
RisingWave integrates real-time stream processing and low-latency serving in a single system. It [continuously ingests data](/ingestion/overview) from streaming and batch sources, [performs incremental computations](/processing/overview) across streams and tables with end-to-end freshness under 100 ms. Materialized views can be [served](/serve/overview) directly within RisingWave with 10–20 ms p99 query latency, or [delivered to downstream systems](/delivery/overview).

### Iceberg lakehouse ingestion, transformation, and management
RisingWave treats Apache Iceberg™ as a [first-class citizen](/iceberg/overview). It directly hosts and manages the Iceberg REST catalog, allowing users to create and operate Iceberg tables through a [PostgreSQL-compatible interface](/iceberg/ov-internal). RisingWave supports [two write modes](/iceberg/write-modes): Merge-on-Read (MoR) and Copy-on-Write (CoW), to suit different ingestion and query patterns. It also provides [built-in table maintenance](/iceberg/maintenance) capabilities, including compaction, small-file optimization, vacuum, and snapshot cleanup, ensuring efficient and consistent data management without external tools or pipelines.

_Plug: [Nimtable](https://github.com/nimtable/nimtable) is an observability tool developed by RisingWave for easily exploring and managing Iceberg tables._



## Key design decisions

RisingWave is built for ease of use and cost efficiency.  

### PostgreSQL compatibility  

RisingWave is wire-compatible with PostgreSQL, enabling:  
- **[Expressive SQL](/sql/overview):** Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with a familiar SQL dialect.  
- **Seamless integration:** Works with psql, JDBC, and any PostgreSQL-compatible tool via the PostgreSQL wire protocol.

### Object storage as primary storage  

RisingWave stores tables, materialized views, and internal states of stream processing jobs in object storage (e.g., S3, GCS, MinIO), providing:  
- **High performance:** Optimized for complex queries, including joins and time windowing, without the need for complex state management.  
- **Fast recovery:** Restores from system failures within seconds.  
- **[Dynamic scaling](/deploy/k8s-cluster-scaling):** Instantly adjusts resources to handle workload spikes.  

Beyond caching hot data in memory, RisingWave supports [**elastic disk cache**](/get-started/disk-cache), a powerful performance optimization that uses local disks or EBS for efficient data caching. This minimizes access to object storage like S3, lowering processing latency and cutting object store access costs.

### Apache Iceberg™ native support

RisingWave [**natively integrates with Apache Iceberg™**](/iceberg/overview), enabling continuous ingestion of streaming data into Iceberg tables. It can also read directly from Iceberg, perform automatic compaction, and maintain table health over time. Since Iceberg is an open table format, results are accessible by other query engines — making storage not only cost-efficient, but interoperable by design.

## Classic use cases

RisingWave is particularly effective for the following use cases:

* **Live dashboards**: Achieve sub-second data freshness in live dashboards, ideal for high-stakes scenarios like stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring.
* **Monitoring and alerting**: Develop sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for critical applications such as fraud and anomaly detection.
* **Real-time data enrichment**: Continuously ingest data from diverse sources, conduct real-time data enrichment, and efficiently deliver the results to downstream systems.
* **Feature engineering**: Transform batch and streaming data into features in your machine learning models using a unified codebase, ensuring seamless integration and consistency.
* **Iceberg-based lakehouses**: Power real-time lakehouse architectures where streaming data is continuously written to Apache Iceberg™ tables for unified analytics, governance, and long-term retention in open formats.
