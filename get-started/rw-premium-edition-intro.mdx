## What is RisingWave Premium?

The RisingWave Premium Edition is a feature-rich paid offering built on top of the open-source RisingWave Community Edition that is available from RisingWave v2.0\. Designed for enterprises and organizations with mission-critical data infrastructure needs, the Premium Edition provides a suite of enterprise-grade capabilities to help users maximize the benefits of their RisingWave deployments.

While the Premium Edition is a paid offering, it is designed to complement and enhance the open-source RisingWave Community Edition. The Community Edition will continue to be freely available under the Apache License (Version 2.0), and we remain committed to supporting the needs of our open-source community and ecosystem.

The RisingWave Community Edition and Premium Edition share the same underlying binary or container image. Users of the Community Edition need to purchase a license key to access the Premium Edition features.

For RisingWave Cloud users, all Premium Edition features are available out of the box without additional cost.

## Premium features

The following are Premium Edition features, which include a "Premium Edition Feature" note in the documentation.

### Tooling

Premium Edition customers can take advantage of our on-prem management tool to enhance observability for their RisingWave clusters. This tool accelerates issue detection, streamlines troubleshooting, and optimizes performance.
  
A lightweight version is available under the Apache 2.0 License: [Wavekit-lite](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/wavekit-lite).

### Performance and cost

The [**Elastic disk cache**](/get-started/disk-cache) feature harnesses modern hardware to dramatically reduce S3 access costs - by up to **90%** - while enhancing performance and improving robustness. [Contact us](https://risingwave.com/contact-us/) to learn more.

### SQL and security

- [Time travel queries](/processing/time-travel-queries)
- [Secret management](/operate/manage-secrets)

### Schema management

- Automatic schema mapping to the source tables for [PostgreSQL CDC](/integrations/sources/postgresql-cdc#automatically-map-upstream-table-schema) and [MySQL CDC](/integrations/sources/mysql-cdc#automatically-map-upstream-table-schema)
- [Automatic schema change for MySQL CDC](/integrations/sources/mysql-cdc#automatically-change-schema)
- [AWS Glue Schema Registry](/integrations/sources/kafka#read-schemas-from-aws-glue-schema-registry)

### Connectors

- [Sink to Snowflake](/integrations/destinations/snowflake)
- [Sink to DynamoDB](/integrations/destinations/amazon-dynamodb)
- [Sink to OpenSearch](/integrations/destinations/opensearch)
- [Sink to BigQuery](/integrations/destinations/bigquery)
- [Sink to SharedMergeTree table engine on ClickHouse Cloud](/integrations/destinations/clickhouse#supported-table-engines)
- [Sink to SQL Server](/integrations/destinations/sql-server)
- [Direct SQL Server CDC source connector](/integrations/sources/sql-server-cdc)
- [Sink to Iceberg with glue catalog](/integrations/destinations/apache-iceberg#glue-catelogs)

For users who are already using these features in 1.9.x or earlier versions, rest assured that the functionality of these features will be intact if you stay on the version. If you choose to upgrade to v2.0 or later versions, an error will show up to indicate you need a license to use the features.

The premium features are carefully selected based on the following criteria:

- Seamless integration with proprietary or licensed open-source systems.
- Advanced features that enhance development velocity and lower production deployment overhead.
- Performance improvements for non-standard deployment environments.
- Tailored features specifically requested by our paying customers.

## How to access Premium Edition features

For RisingWave Cloud users, all Premium Edition features are available out of the box without additional cost.

Users of the Community Edition need to purchase and set up a license key to access Premium Edition features. The license key, essentially a certificate, is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that encodes information such as the license tier and expiration time. The integrity of the license key is validated using asymmetric encryption.

### Free trial

RisingWave provides a trial of paid features for clusters with up to 4 compute node CPUs, allowing you to evaluate these features on a small scale. When there are more CPUs in the cluster, the trial will be unavailable for both existing and future jobs, and you will need to acquire a license key to continue using the paid features.

- For a fresh deployment, this free trail is included automatically.
- For an existing deployment upgrading to this version, you may need to refresh the license key by executing `ALTER SYSTEM SET license_key TO DEFAULT;` in the SQL shell to activate the trial.

### Set license key

Depending on the deployment, there are several different ways of setting license key.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RisingWave Operator (Kubernetes)">
  If you used the [RisingWave Operator](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator) to deploy the RisingWave, 
  you could follow the steps to set the license key. 
  For detailed instructions of deploying RisingWave with the RisingWave Operator, please check the [Deploy RisingWave on Kubernetes with Operator](deploy/risingwave-kubernetes).

1. Prepare a secret under the same namespace as the RisingWave object, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: risingwave-license
    stringData:
      licenseKey: |
        <content of the license key>
    ```

2. Set the following fields of the RisingWave object.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: risingwave.risingwavelabs.com/v1alpha1
    kind: RisingWave
    metadata:
      name: <your-risingwave>
    spec:
      licenseKey:
        secretName: risingwave-license # the name of the secret above
        secretKey: licenseKey # the key in the secret above referencing the data of the license key
    ```

3. Apply the RisingWave object to Kubernetes.

The pod of the meta node (or standalone node) will restart to reflect the license key.

If you'd like to renew the license key afterwards, you could simply update the content of the secret created above. The change will be propagated to and loaded by RisingWave automatically.

  </Tab>
<Tab title="Helm (Kubernetes)">

If you used the [Helm chart](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/risingwave) to deploy the RisingWave,
you could follow the steps to set the license key.
For detailed instructions of deploying RisingWave with Helm, please check the [Deploy RisingWave on Kubernetes with Helm](deploy/risingwave-k8s-helm).

1. Prepare a secret under the same namespace as the RisingWave Helm release, e.g.,

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: risingwave-license
   stringData:
     licenseKey: |
       <content of the license key>
   ```

2. Set the following values, e.g., in the `values.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   license:
     secret:
       name: "risingwave-license"
       key: "licenseKey"
   ```

3. Apply the values with the helm command-line tool.

    ```shell
    # For fresh installation, you could provide additional values with more "-f <values.yaml>"
    # For more information of the helm install, please refer to https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/
    helm install -f values.yaml [-f <other-values.yaml>] <release-name> risingwavelabs/risingwave

    # For upgrading existing one.
    # For more information of the helm upgrade, please refer to https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/
    helm upgrade -f values.yaml --reuse-values <release-name> risingwavelabs/risingwave
    ```

The pod of the meta node (or standalone node) will restart afterwards to set the license key.

If you'd like to renew the license key afterwards, you could simply update the content of the secret created above. The change will be propagated to and loaded by RisingWave automatically.

</Tab>

<Tab title="SQL">

For an existing cluster, use this SQL command:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET license_key TO '...';
```

Note you'll need to rotate the license by yourself with the same SQL command before expiration.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Local">

There are several ways to set your license key to a local RisingWave:

1. Add `system.license_key` to your TOML configuration file before launching a new RisingWave
2. Set `RW_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable on meta node
3. Use the `--license-key-path` CLI option or the `RW_LICENSE_KEY_PATH` environment variable on meta node to specify a file holding the license key.
   Changes to the file will be monitored and meta node will reload the license key. This helps streamline license key rotation.

When the `--license-key-path` option or the `RW_LICENSE_KEY_PATH` environment variable is specified, any manual configuration of the license key through
system parameters (`license_key`), the initial configuration (`system.license_key`), or the `RW_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable will be rejected.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Verify license key

To check if your license key is valid, run:

```sql
SELECT rw_test_paid_tier();
```

A result of `t` means the key is valid; an error message indicates an invalid key.
