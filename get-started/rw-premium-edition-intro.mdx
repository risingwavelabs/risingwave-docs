## What is RisingWave Premium?

The RisingWave Premium Edition is a feature-rich paid offering built on top of the open-source RisingWave Community Edition that is available from RisingWave v2.0\. Designed for enterprises and organizations with mission-critical data infrastructure needs, the Premium Edition provides a suite of enterprise-grade capabilities to help users maximize the benefits of their RisingWave deployments.

While the Premium Edition is a paid offering, it is designed to complement and enhance the open-source RisingWave Community Edition. The Community Edition will continue to be freely available under the Apache License (Version 2.0), and we remain committed to supporting the needs of our open-source community and ecosystem.

The RisingWave Community Edition and Premium Edition share the same underlying binary or container image. Users of the Community Edition need to purchase a license key to access the Premium Edition features.

For RisingWave Cloud users, all Premium Edition features are available out of box without additional cost. 

## Premium features

The premium features are carefully selected based on the following criteria:

- Seamless integration with proprietary or licensed open-source systems.
- Advanced features that enhance development velocity and lower production deployment overhead.
- Performance improvements for non-standard deployment environments.
- Tailored features specifically requested by our paying customers.

The following are Premium Edition features, which include a "Premium Edition Feature" note in the documentation.

For users who are already using these features in 1.9.x or earlier versions, rest assured that the functionality of these features will be intact if you stay on the version. If you choose to upgrade to v2.0 or later versions, an error will show up to indicate you need a license to use the features.

## How to access Premium Edition features

For RisingWave Cloud users, all Premium Edition features are available out of the box without additional cost.

Users of the Community Edition need to purchase and set up a license key to access Premium Edition features. The license key, essentially a certificate, is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that encodes information such as the license tier and expiration time. The integrity of the license key is validated using asymmetric encryption.

### Set license key

There are two primary methods for setting the license key in your environment:

#### Manual method

To set your license key manually:

1. Before launching a new cluster:
   * Add `system.license_key` to your TOML configuration file, or
   * Set `RW_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable
2. For an existing cluster, use this SQL command:
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET license_key TO '...';
```

#### Automated method

To set your license key automatically:

1. Use the `--license-key-path` CLI option for the meta node to monitor and reload the license key from a specified file. This streamlines license key rotation in Cloud environments.
2. Alternatively, set the `RW_LICENSE_KEY_PATH` environment variable.

The `--license-key-path` CLI option is only available for the meta node, as the license key is propagated to other nodes through system parameters. When the `--license-key-path` option is specified, any manual configuration of the license key through system parameters (`license_key`), the initial configuration (`system.license_key`), or the `RW_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable will be rejected.

### Verify license key

To check if your license key is valid, run:

```sql
SELECT rw_test_paid_tier();
```

A result of `t` means the key is valid; an error message indicates an invalid key.

## Pricing

Pricing for RisingWave Premium will be based on the cluster size, measured in RisingWave Units (RWUs). The number of RWUs will be determined based on the scale of data ingestion, number of streaming jobs, and the complexity of use case. There could be additional factors as well.
