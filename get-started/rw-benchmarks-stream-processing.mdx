## Benchmark methodology

The performance tests were conducted using the Nexmark benchmark, a widely recognized standard in the stream processing field. In addition to the standard Nexmark queries, an extended set of 5 queries was included to cover a broader range of common SQL operators.

### Environment

- **Hardware:** Cloud Isolation Environment using single-node instances (8 vCPUs, 16GB memory) with S3 storage. Each pod exclusively occupies one machine.
- **RisingWave version:** nightly-20230309
- **RisingWave configuration:**
    
    ```yaml
    [storage]
    block_cache_capacity_mb = 2048
    meta_cache_capacity_mb = 512
    compactor_memory_limit_mb = 2560
    shared_buffer_capacity_mb = 2048
    ```
    

### Test procedure

1. Data was populated into Kafka using the [**nexmark-bench**](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/nexmark-bench) tool.
2. Nexmark Kafka sources were created using [**these SQLs**](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/nexmark-risingwave-1.0/blob/main/manifests/nexmark/nexmark-kafka-sources.template.yaml).
3. [**CREATE SINK (blackhole)**](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/nexmark-risingwave-1.0/blob/main/manifests/nexmark/nexmark-sinks.template.yaml) was used to test the performance and cost of Nexmark queries.
4. The RisingWave cluster was deployed via [**kube-bench**](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/nexmark-risingwave-1.0).


## Performance comparison with Flink

RisingWave's performance has been extensively benchmarked against Apache Flink, providing valuable insights into its relative strengths. The comparison reveals significant performance advantages in most streaming scenarios.

### Key comparative findings

- RisingWave outperformed Flink in 22 out of 27 queries
- 12 queries showed performance improvements of ≥50% compared to Flink
- 10 queries demonstrated more than 2x performance improvement
- Exceptional improvements were observed in:
  - Dynamic filtering operations (q102: 520x faster)
  - Anti-join operations (q104: 660x faster)
  - Complex state management queries (q7: 62x faster)

### Performance characteristics by query type

#### Strong performance advantage (>2x faster than Flink)
- Queries with large internal states (>20GB)
- Complex join operations
- Dynamic filtering operations
- Aggregations with large state management

#### Comparable performance (90-110% of Flink)
- Basic stateless computations
- Simple filtering operations
- Network I/O bound operations

#### Areas for optimization (performing below Flink)
- Window aggregations without EOWC support (q5)
- Distinct aggregations without split optimization (q16)


## Key performance factors

RisingWave's performance advantages can be attributed to several design and implementation choices:

1. Rust-based architecture: RisingWave is built from the ground up in Rust and minimizes reliance on third-party JVM components. This provides inherent performance benefits at the computation layer.
2. Direct SQL optimization: Unlike systems with multiple abstraction layers, RisingWave directly optimizes SQL queries, enabling highly customized performance tuning.
3. Computation-aware storage: RisingWave's custom storage implementation is aware of the computation, allowing for intelligent state management and reduced storage costs by leveraging remote storage (e.g., S3, HDFS).

## Areas of strength

RisingWave excels in scenarios with:

- Complex stateful computations: Queries requiring large and complex internal states benefit significantly from RisingWave's efficient state management.
- Multi-stream joins: Initial tests indicate that RisingWave can efficiently handle joins of multiple data streams, making it suitable for scenarios with multiple data sources.

## Considerations

- Stateless computations: Performance gains in stateless computations might be less pronounced when network I/O between RisingWave and the data source (e.g., Kafka) becomes the bottleneck.
- Performance degradation: Reducing compute node memory or introducing irregular access patterns can lead to a high cache miss rate, impacting performance due to increased access to remote storage.
- Emit On Window Close (EOWC): RisingWave will soon support EOWC semantics, which can optimize window aggregation functions.
- Split distinct aggregation: RisingWave will add the optimization for split distinct aggregation in the future, which will further improve the performance for queries like q16.

## Future performance evaluations

Further testing is planned to evaluate RisingWave's performance in areas such as:

- Complex stateful computations: Including operations like JSON parsing and string processing.
- Multi-stream joins: Releasing detailed results of multi-stream join experiments.
- Advanced features: Assessing the impact of UDFs, watermarks, and other advanced features on performance.
