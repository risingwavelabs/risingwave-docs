RisingWave is a streaming-first data platform that excels in real-time data processing. This guide helps you get started with the most common scenarios and data sources.

## Start with your data source

Most users work with PostgreSQL or Kafka. Start here if you're new to RisingWave:

### Work with PostgreSQL

Learn how to ingest data from PostgreSQL using Change Data Capture (CDC), create tables, and build real-time pipelines.

**What you'll learn:**
- Set up PostgreSQL CDC connections
- Create tables from PostgreSQL sources
- Build real-time materialized views
- Handle updates and deletes

### Work with Kafka

Learn how to ingest data from Kafka topics, process streaming events, and build real-time analytics pipelines.

**What you'll learn:**
- Connect to Kafka topics
- Query Kafka sources directly
- Create materialized views for real-time processing
- Deliver results to downstream systems

## Common use cases

Once you're comfortable with data ingestion, explore these common use cases:

### Monitoring and alerting

Build real-time monitoring and alerting systems that detect anomalies, fraud, and critical events with sub-second latency.
