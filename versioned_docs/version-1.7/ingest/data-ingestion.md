You can ingest data into RisingWave in two ways:

- Connect to and ingest data from external sources such as databases and message brokers.
- Use SQL statements to insert, update or delete data in tables directly.

## Ingest data from external sources

To ingest data from external sources into RisingWave, you need to create a source ([`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/commands/sql-create-source.md)) or a table with connector settings ([`CREATE TABLE`](/sql/commands/sql-create-table.md)) in RisingWave.

The syntax for creating a source is similar to creating a table with connector settings:

```sql
CREATE {TABLE | SOURCE} source_or_table_name 
[optional_schema_definition]
WITH (
   connector='kafka',
   connector_parameter='value', ...
)
...
```

When connector settings are specified for a table in RisingWave, it is able to store streaming data. However, a table with connector settings is different from a source in RisingWave.

- A source does not persist all data that flows in. It persists only results from materialized views. It accepts only append-only data, such as application events or log messages.
- A table with connector settings persists all data that flows in. It accepts both append-only data and updatable data. To accept updatable data, you need to specify a primary key when creating the table. Data in `upsert`, `debezium`, `canal`, or `maxwell` format are examples of updatable data.

Regardless of whether data is persisted in RisingWave, you can create materialized views to transform or analyze them.

## Insert data into tables (without connectors)

You can also load data to RisingWave by creating tables ([`CREATE TABLE`](/sql/commands/sql-create-table.md)) and inserting data into tables ([`INSERT`](/sql/commands/sql-insert.md)).

## Supported sources and formats
