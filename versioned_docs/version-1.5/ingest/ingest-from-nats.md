You can ingest data from NATS JetStream into RisingWave by using the NATS source connector in RisingWave.

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is an open source messaging system for cloud native applications. It provides a lightweight publish-subscribe architecture for high performance messaging.

[NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) is a streaming data platform built on top of NATS. It enables real-time and historical access to streams of data via durable subscriptions and consumer groups.

:::note Beta Feature
The NATS source connector in RisingWave is currently in Beta. Please contact us if you encounter any issues or have feedback.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before ingesting data from NATS JetStream into RisingWave, please ensure the following:

- The NATS JetStream server is running and accessible from your RisingWave cluster.
- If authentication is required for the NATS JetStream server, make sure you have the client username and password. The client user must have the `subscribe` permission for the subject.
- Create the NATS subject from which you want to ingest data.
- Ensure that your RisingWave cluster is running.

## Ingest data into RisingWave

When creating a source, you can choose to persist the data from the source in RisingWave by using `CREATE TABLE` instead of `CREATE SOURCE` and specifying the connection settings and data format.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE { TABLE | SOURCE} [ IF NOT EXISTS ] source_name 
[ schema_definition ]
WITH (
   connector='nats',
   server_url='<your nats server>:<port>', [ <another_server_url_if_available>, ...]
   subject='<subject>[,<another_subject...]',
   stream='stream_name',

-- optional parameters
   connect_mode=<connect_mode>
   username='<your user name>',
   password='<your password>'
   jwt=`<your jwt>`,
   nkey=`<your nkey>`

-- delivery parameters
   scan.startup.mode=`startup_mode`
   scan.startup.timestamp_millis='xxxxx',
)
FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

**schema_definition**:

```sql
(
   column_name data_type [ PRIMARY KEY ], ...
   [ PRIMARY KEY ( column_name, ... ) ]
)
```

:::note

RisingWave performs primary key constraint checks on tables with connector settings but not on regular sources. If you need the checks to be performed, please create a table with connector settings.

For a table with primary key constraints, if a new data record with an existing key comes in, the new record will overwrite the existing record.

:::note

According to the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/jetstream_admin/naming), stream names must adhere to subject naming rules as well as being friendly to the file system. Here are the recommended guidelines for stream names:

- Use alphanumeric values.
- Avoid spaces, tabs, periods (`.`), greater than (`>`) or asterisks (`*`).
- Do not include path separators (forward slash or backward slash).
- Keep the name length limited to 32 characters as the JetStream storage directories include the account, stream name, and consumer name.
- Avoid using reserved file names like `NUL` or `LPT1`.
- Be cautious of case sensitivity in file systems. To prevent collisions, ensure that stream or account names do not clash due to case differences. For example, `Foo` and `foo` would collide on Windows or macOS systems.

### Parameters

|Field|Notes|
|---|---|
|`server_url`| Required. URLs of the NATS JetStream server, in the format of *address*:*port*. If multiple addresses are specified, use commas to separate them.|
|`subject`| Required. NATS subject that you want to ingest data from. To specify more than one subjects, use a comma.|
|`stream` | Required. NATS stream that you want to ingest data from.|
|`connect_mode`|Required. Authentication mode for the connection. Allowed values: <ul><li>`plain`: No authentication. </li><li>`user_and_password`: Use user name and password for authentication. For this option, `username` and `password` must be specified.</li><li> `credential`: Use JSON Web Token (JWT) and NKeys for authentication. For this option, `jwt` and `nkey` must be specified.</li></ul> |
|`jwt` and `nkey`|JWT and NKEY for authentication. For details, see [JWT](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/jwt) and [NKeys](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth).|
|`username` and `password`| Conditional. The client user name and password. Required when `connect_mode` is `user_and_password`.|
|`scan.startup.mode`|Optional. The offset mode that RisingWave will use to consume data. The supported modes are: <ul><li>`earliest`: Consume data from the earliest offset.</li><li>`latest`: Consume data from the latest offset.</li><li>`timestamp_millis`: Consume data from a particular UNIX timestamp, which is specified via `scan.startup.timestamp_millis`.</li></ul>If not specified, the default value `earliest` will be used.|
|`scan.startup.timestamp_millis`|Conditional. Required when `scan.startup.mode` is `timestamp_millis`. RisingWave will start to consume data from the specified UNIX timestamp (milliseconds).|

## What's next

After the source or table is created, you can create materialized views to transform or analyze your streaming data.
