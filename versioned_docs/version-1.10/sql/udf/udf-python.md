This article provides a step-by-step guide for installing the RisingWave UDF API, defining functions in a Python file, starting the UDF server, and declaring and using UDFs in RisingWave.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or later) installed on your computer.

- Ensure that you have [started and connected to RisingWave](get-started.md#run-risingwave).

## 1. Install the RisingWave UDF API for Python

Run the following command to download and install the RisingWave UDF API package and its dependencies.

```shell
pip install arrow-udf
```

```python title="udf.py"
# Import components from the arrow-udf module
from arrow_udf import udf, udtf, UdfServer

# Define a scalar function that returns a single value
@udf(input_types=['INT', 'INT'], result_type='INT')
def gcd(x, y):
    while y != 0:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

# Define a scalar function to perform some blocking operation, setting the `io_threads` parameter to run multiple function calls concurrently on a thread pool
@udf(input_types=["INT"], result_type="INT", io_threads=32)
def blocking(x):
    time.sleep(0.01) 
    return x

# Define a scalar function that returns multiple values within a struct
@udf(input_types=['VARCHAR'], result_type='STRUCT<key: VARCHAR, value: VARCHAR>')
def key_value(pair: str):
    key, value = pair.split('=')
    return {'key': key, 'value': value}

# Define a table function over a Python generator function
@udtf(input_types='INT', result_types='INT')
def series(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

# Start a UDF server
if __name__ == '__main__':
    server = UdfServer(location="0.0.0.0:8815") # You can use any available port in your system. Here we use port 8815.
    server.add_function(gcd)
    server.add_function(key_value)
    server.add_function(series)
    server.serve()
```

<details>
<summary>See code explanation</summary>

The script first imports the `struct` and `socket` modules and three components from the `risingwave.udf` module - `udf`, `udtf`.

`udf` and `udtf` are decorators used to define scalar and table functions respectively.

The code defines three scalar functions and one table function:

- The scalar function `gcd`, decorated with `@udf`, takes two integer inputs and returns the greatest common divisor of the two integers. 
- The scalar function `blocking`, decorated with `@udf`. The `io_threads` parameter specifies the number of threads that the Python UDF will use during execution to enhance processing performance of IO-intensive functions. Please note that multithreading can not speed up compute-intensive functions due to the GIL.
- The scalar function `key_value`, decorated with `@udf`, takes a single string input and returns a structured output.
- The table function `series`, decorated by `@udtf`, takes an integer input and yields a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`.

Finally, the script starts a UDF server using `UdfServer` and listens for incoming requests on port 8815 of the local machine. It then adds the `gcd`, `key_value` and `series` functions to the server and starts the server using the `serve()` method. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` conditional is used to ensure that the server is only started if the script is run directly, rather than being imported as a module.

</details>

:::info
New sample functions are frequently added to `udf.py`, such as JSONB functions. See the [source file](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/blob/main/e2e_test/udf/test.py).

Some of the sample functions are still being tested and may not be fully functional or optimized.
:::

## 3. Start the UDF server

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where `udf.py` is saved.

1. Run this command to execute `udf.py`.

    ```shell
    python3 udf.py
    ```

The UDF server will start running, allowing you to call the defined UDFs from RisingWave.

## 4. Declare your functions in RisingWave

In RisingWave, use the [`CREATE FUNCTION`](/sql/commands/sql-create-function.md) command to declare the functions you defined.

Here are the SQL statements for declaring the four UDFs defined in [step 2](#2-define-your-functions-in-a-python-file).

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION gcd(int, int) RETURNS int
LANGUAGE python AS gcd USING LINK 'http://localhost:8815'; -- If you are running RisingWave using Docker, replace the address with 'http://host.docker.internal:8815'.

CREATE FUNCTION blocking(int) RETURNS int
LANGUAGE python AS blocking USING LINK 'http://localhost:8815'; -- If you are running RisingWave using Docker, replace the address with 'http://host.docker.internal:8815'.

CREATE FUNCTION key_value(bytea) RETURNS struct<key varchar, value varchar> -- the field names must exactly match the ones in Python decorator
LANGUAGE python AS key_value USING LINK 'http://localhost:8815'; -- If you are running RisingWave using Docker, replace the address with 'http://host.docker.internal:8815'.

CREATE FUNCTION series(int) RETURNS TABLE (x int)
LANGUAGE python AS series USING LINK 'http://localhost:8815'; -- If you are running RisingWave using Docker, replace the address with 'http://host.docker.internal:8815'.
```

## 5. Use your functions in RisingWave

Once the UDFs are created in RisingWave, you can use them in SQL queries just like any built-in functions.

#### Example

```sql
SELECT gcd(25, 15);
---
5

SELECT blocking(2);
---
2

SELECT key_value('a=b');
---
(a,b)

SELECT * FROM series(5);
---
0
1
2
3
4
```

## 6. Scale the UDF Server

Due to the limitations of the Python interpreter's [Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)](https://realpython.com/python-gil/), the UDF server can only utilize a single CPU core when processing requests. If you find that the throughput of the UDF server is insufficient, consider scaling out the UDF server.

:::info
How to determine if the UDF server needs scaling?

You can use tools like `top` to monitor the CPU usage of the UDF server. If the CPU usage is close to 100%, it indicates that the CPU resources of the UDF server are insufficient, and scaling is necessary.
:::

To scale the UDF server, you can launch multiple UDF servers on different ports and use a load balancer to distribute requests among these servers.

The specific code is as follows:

```python title="udf.py"
from multiprocessing import Pool

def start_server(port: int):
    """Start a UDF server listening on the specified port."""
    server = UdfServer(location=f"localhost:{port}")
    # add functions ...
    server.serve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    """Start multiple servers listening on different ports."""
    n = 4
    with Pool(n) as p:
        p.map(start_server, range(8816, 8816 + n))
```

Then, you can start a load balancer, such as Nginx. It listens on port 8815 and forwards requests to UDF servers on ports 8816-8819.

## Migration Guide from risingwave 0.1 to arrow-udf 0.2

If you have used the Python UDF SDK in RisingWave 1.9 or earlier versions, please refer to the following steps for upgrading.

Import the `arrow_udf` package instead of `risingwave.udf`.

```shell
pip install arrow-udf
```

```diff
- from risingwave.udf import udf, udtf, UdfServer
+ from arrow_udf import udf, udtf, UdfServer
```

The type aliases `FLOAT4` and `FLOAT8` are removed and replaced by `REAL` and `DOUBLE PRECISION`.

```diff
- @udf(input_types=['FLOAT4', 'FLOAT8'], result_type='INT')
+ @udf(input_types=['REAL', 'DOUBLE PRECISION'], result_type='INT')
```

The `STRUCT` type now requires field names. The field names must exactly match the ones defined in `CREATE FUNCTION`.
The function that returns a struct type now returns a dictionary instead of a tuple. The field names of the dictionary must match the definition in the signature.

```diff
- @udf(input_types=['VARCHAR'], result_type='STRUCT<VARCHAR, VARCHAR>')
+ @udf(input_types=['VARCHAR'], result_type='STRUCT<key: VARCHAR, value: VARCHAR>')
  def key_value(pair: str):
      key, value = pair.split('=')
-     return (key, value)
+     return {'key': key, 'value': value}
```
