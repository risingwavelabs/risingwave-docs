## What are system parameters?

System parameters in RisingWave refer to the parameters that advanced users can use to adjust how internal components work in RisingWave.

Currently, these system parameters are available in RisingWave.

| Parameter           |    Description    |
|---|---|
|`barrier_interval_ms`     | The time interval of the periodic barriers.|
|`checkpoint_frequency`      | Specify the number of barriers for which a checkpoint will be created. The value must be a positive integer.|
|`sstable_size_mb`          | The target size of SSTable.|
|`parallel_compact_size_mb` |This parameter, together with `max_sub_compaction`, controls the concurrency of individual tasks. If the data size is smaller than `parallel_compact_size_mb`, only a single thread is used to execute the compaction task. If the data size of an individual task exceeds `parallel_compact_size_mb`, multiple concurrent threads are started to complete the task. At this time, if the data size is N, then the total number of these threads is determined by dividing N by `parallel_compact_size_mb`. Additionally,  each sub-task's size cannot exceed `parallel_compact_size_mb`, and the total number of sub-tasks cannot exceed `max_sub_compaction`.|
|`block_size_kb`          | The size of each block in bytes in SSTable.|
|`bloom_false_positive`     | False positive rate of bloom filter in SSTable.|
|`state_store`             | The state store URL. |
|`data_directory`           | The remote directory for storing data and metadata objects.|
|`backup_storage_url`       | The URL of the remote storage for backups.|
|`backup_storage_directory` | The directory of the remote storage for backups.|
|`telemetry_enabled` | Whether to enable telemetry or not. For more information, see [Telemetry](/telemetry.md).|
|`max_concurrent_creating_streaming_jobs`|The maximum number of streaming jobs that can be created concurrently. That is, the maximum of materialized views, indexes, tables, sinks, or sources that can be created concurrently. |
|`pause_on_next_bootstrap`|This parameter is used for debugging and maintenance purposes. Setting it to `true` will pause all data sources, such as connectors and DMLs, when the cluster restarts. This parameter will then be reset to its default value (`false`). To resume data ingestion, simply run `risectl meta resume` or restart the cluster again. |
|`enable_tracing`|Whether to enable distributed tracing. This parameter is used to toggle the opentelemetry tracing during runtime. Its default value is `false`.|


## How to view system parameters?

You can use the `SHOW PARAMETERS` command to view the system parameters, along with their current values.

The `Mutable` column indicates whether the parameter can be altered using the [ALTER SYSTEM SET](#how-to-configure-system-parameters) command after the system is running. `t` means it can be altered using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` command while `f` means it cannot be altered using the command.

```sql
SHOW PARAMETERS;
```

```markdown
           Name                         |     Value      | Mutable 
----------------------------------------+----------------+---------
 barrier_interval_ms                    | 1000           | t
 checkpoint_frequency                   | 1              | t
 sstable_size_mb                        | 256            | f
 parallel_compact_size_mb               | 512            | f
 block_size_kb                          | 64             | f
 bloom_false_positive                   | 0.001          | f
 state_store                            | hummock+memory | f
 data_directory                         | hummock_001    | f
 backup_storage_url                     | memory         | t
 backup_storage_directory               | hummock_001/backup | t
 max_concurrent_creating_streaming_jobs | 1              | t
 pause_on_next_bootstrap                | false          | t
 enable_tracing                         | false          | t
```

## How to configure system parameters?

Mutable and immutable parameters are configured differently.

You can configure mutable parameters using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` command in `psql`.

The full syntax of the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` statement is:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET parameter_name { TO | = } { value | 'value' | DEFAULT };
```

Immutable parameters need to be initialized in the CLI of the meta node. `state_store` and `data_directory` need to be initialized before starting a cluster.

To configure parameter settings in the CLI of the meta node, navigate to the directory where RisingWave is installed and run the following command:

```shell
meta-node --<parameter_name> <value>
```

For example, to initialize the setting of `data_directory`:

`meta-node --data_directory "hummock_001"`

:::note

As RisingWave reads system parameters at different times, there is no guarantee that a parameter value change will take effect immediately. We recommend that you adjust system parameters before running a streaming query after your RisingWave cluster starts.
