[Row Security Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) is a powerful feature in PostgreSQL that allows you to control access to rows in a table based on specific policies . 
Currently, RisingWave does not support Row Security Policies, but this doc will help you implement Row-level Security with existing features. 

## Using logical views implement RLS for query

By using [logical views](/sql/commands/sql-create-view) with [access control](/operate/access-control), you can create a robust security model that ensures users only access data they are authorized to see.

Imagine you have a table `employees` that stores employee information, including their department and salary. You want to enforce the following access rules:

1. **HR Managers** can view all employees in the HR department.
2. **Engineering Managers** can view all employees in the Engineering department.
3. **CEO** can view all employees

To achieve this, weâ€™ll use **logical views** to filter data based on user roles and **user permissions** to restrict access to the underlying table.

### Step 1: Create the `employees` Table

First, create the `employees` table to store employee data:

```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        name TEXT,
        department TEXT,
        salary NUMERIC,
        username TEXT
    );
```

### Step 2: Insert Sample Data
Insert some sample data into the employees table:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, username) VALUES
('Alice', 'HR', 50000, 'alice'),
('Bob', 'Engineering', 60000, 'bob'),
('Charlie', 'HR', 55000, 'charlie'),
('David', 'Engineering', 65000, 'david');
```

### Step 3: Create Users

Next, create three users: hr_manager, engineering_manager, and ceo.

```sql
CREATE USER hr_manager WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE USER engineering_manager WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE USER ceo WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```

### Step 4: Create Logical Views for Each User
Create logical views for each user to restrict their access to specific data.

View for HR Manager
HR Manager can only view employees in the HR department:

```sql
CREATE VIEW hr_employee_view AS
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';

GRANT SELECT ON hr_employee_view TO hr_manager;
```

View for Engineering Manager
Engineering Manager can only view employees in the Engineering department:

```sql
CREATE VIEW engineering_employee_view AS
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering';

GRANT SELECT ON engineering_employee_view TO engineering_manager;
```

View for CEO
CEO can view all employees:

```sql
CREATE VIEW all_employee_view AS
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees;

GRANT SELECT ON all_employee_view TO ceo;
```
