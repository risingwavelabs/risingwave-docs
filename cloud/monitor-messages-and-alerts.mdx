RisingWave Cloud provides a centralized **Messages and Alerts** interface to view and manage all system notifications for your projects. It helps you quickly identify issues, understand their impact, and ensure the right people are notified in time. You can filter alerts by severity and function category, review details, and configure notification preferences.

## Dashboard

In RisingWave Cloud, click the bell icon in the top-right corner to open the **Messages and Alerts** dashboard. It allows you to filter notifications for efficient monitoring and issue diagnosis.

You can filter notifications by two main criteria:

- **Severity levels**: Alerts are classified by severity to help prioritize your response.

    | Severity levels| Description      | Example     |
    |:---------------|:-----------------|:------------|
    | Critical       | Issues requiring immediate attention to avoid service disruption or data loss. | Streaming job failure, node outage.   |
    | Warning        | Non-blocking issues that may escalate if unaddressed.                     | High memory usage, compaction delays. |
    | Info        | Informational updates that do not indicate a problem.                     | Customer service contact changed.  |


- **Function categories**: Alerts are classified by the relevant system component or function.

    | Category           | Description   |
    |:------------------|:---------------|
    | Service Health     | Status and availability of core services.        |
    | Streaming          | Data pipeline performance and processing errors.                   |
    | Compaction         | Storage compaction schedules, delays, or failures.                 |
    | Project operations | Project-level changes, deployments, or failures.   |
    | Billing            | Usage thresholds, billing errors, and payment issues.              |
    | Other            | General informational messages.              |

## Alert playbooks

**Alert playbooks** are provided to guide you through effective incident response. Each playbook details an alert's description, common triggers, and provides step-by-step instructions for diagnosis and resolution.
