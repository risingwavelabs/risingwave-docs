In RisingWave, a database user is similar to a database user or role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a project.

Also, you [connect and log in to a project](/cloud/connect-to-a-project/) as one of its database users. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges. Currently, all database users have the superuser privilege. Future releases will introduce more granular permissions.

## Create a database user

Choose one of the following to create a database user.

* You can create a database user when [connecting to a project](/cloud/connect-to-a-project/).
* You can click **Create user** in the **Users** tab on the [project details page](/cloud/check-status-and-metrics/#check-project-details) to create a new user.
* You can run the [CREATE USER](/sql/commands/sql-create-user) command to create a new user after [connecting to a project](/cloud/connect-to-a-project/) using the console or terminal.
Ensure that you have logged in to the project with a user that has the `CREATEUSER` privilege. A super user has all privileges, including `CREATEUSER`.

## Change database user password

You can change the password of any database user in your cluster.

1. Go to the [project details page](/cloud/check-status-and-metrics/#check-project-details).
2. Select the **Users** tab.
3. Click **Change password** of a user.
4. Enter the new password and re-enter it to confirm. You do not need to enter the old password to continue.
5. Click **Save** to apply the change.
