## Pricing Dimensions

Network usage is billed based on the following dimensions:

### 1. Public Network Traffic

Network traffic charges are based on the volume of data moved across public internet, measured in gigabytes (GB). This includes:

- **Ingress** (Data entering RisingWave):
    - **Streaming Data Integration**: Continuously ingesting real-time data streams from external message brokers or sources into RisingWave for immediate processing.
    - **Batch Data Imports**: Loading data from external systems, such as databases or cloud storage, into RisingWave for analytics or processing.
- **Egress** (Data leaving RisingWave):
    - **Data Export to External Destinations**: Sending processed data to external databases, message brokers, or other sinks.
    - **Client Application Queries**: When client applications retrieve query results from RisingWave, the outbound data transfer constitutes egress traffic.

### 2. PrivateLink Usage

PrivateLink enables secure, private connections between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and RisingWave Cloud without exposing traffic to the public internet. Charges for PrivateLink are based on:

- **PrivateLink Hours**: Billed per hour for each active PrivateLink endpoint.
- **PrivateLink Throughput**: Billed per GB of data transferred through the PrivateLink connection.

For more details about how PrivateLink works in RisingWave Cloud, refer to the [PrivateLink Overview](https://docs.risingwave.com/cloud/privatelink-overview).

## Pricing Calculation

Network usage costs are calculated based on actual consumption. Here's a detailed breakdown by cloud provider:

### AWS Pricing

| Category | US and EU Regions | Singapore |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ingress** | $0.07 /GB | $0.082 /GB |
| **Egress** | $0.17 /GB | $0.215 /GB |
| **PrivateLink Ingress Throughput** | $0.013 /GB | $0.013 /GB |
| **PrivateLink Egress Throughput** | $0.013 /GB | $0.013 /GB |
| **PrivateLink Endpoint Hours** | $0.03 /hr | $0.03 /hr |

### GCP Pricing

| Category | Price |
| --- | --- |
| **Ingress** | $0.063 /GB |
| **Egress** | $0.198 /GB |
| **Private Service Connect Throughput** | $0.013 /GB |
| **Private Service Connect Hours** | $0.03 /hr |

#### Example Cost Calculation

To help illustrate how these charges work in practice, here's a sample monthly calculation for AWS (US Regions pricing):

- Ingress: 100 GB × $0.07 = $7.00
- Egress: 50 GB × $0.17 = $8.50
- PrivateLink Hours: 720 hours × $0.03 = $21.60
- PrivateLink Throughput: 150 GB × $0.013 = $1.95

Total Monthly Cost = $39.05

## Best Practices for Reducing Network Cost

To optimize network usage and reduce costs in RisingWave Cloud, consider the following best practices:

- **Monitor and Analyze Network Usage**: Use the Metrics page in the cloud portal to track network usage and identify unexpected traffic in ingress and egress.
- **Use Compression**: Compress data before transferring to minimize network usage.
- **Leverage PrivateLink for Secure and Cost-Effective Transfers**: If connecting from AWS environments, use PrivateLink instead of public internet connections to reduce egress charges.
