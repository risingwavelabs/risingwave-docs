## Pricing Dimensions

Network usage is billed based on the following dimensions:

### 1. Data Transfer (Ingress & Egress)

Data transfer charges are based on the volume of data moved, measured in gigabytes (GB). This includes:

- **Ingress** (Data entering RisingWave):
    - **Streaming Data Integration**: Continuously ingesting real-time data streams from external message brokers or sources into RisingWave for immediate processing.
    - **Batch Data Imports**: Loading data from external systems, such as databases or cloud storage, into RisingWave for analytics or processing.
- **Egress** (Data leaving RisingWave):
    - **Data Export to External Destinations**: Sending processed data to external databases, message brokers, or other sinks.
    - **Client Application Queries**: When client applications retrieve query results from RisingWave, the outbound data transfer constitutes egress traffic.

### 2. PrivateLink Usage

PrivateLink enables secure, private connections between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and RisingWave Cloud without exposing traffic to the public internet. Charges for PrivateLink are based on:

- **PrivateLink Hours**: Billed per hour for each active PrivateLink endpoint.
- **PrivateLink Throughput**: Billed per GB of data transferred through the PrivateLink connection.

For more details about how PrivateLink works in RisingWave Cloud, refer to the [PrivateLink Overview](https://docs.risingwave.com/cloud/privatelink-overview).

## Pricing Calculation

- **Data Transfer**:
    - *Ingress*: Billed per GB of data transferred into RisingWave Cloud.
    - *Egress*: Billed per GB of data transferred out of RisingWave Cloud.
- **PrivateLink Usage**:
    - *PrivateLink Hours*: Billed per hour for each active PrivateLink endpoint.
    - *PrivateLink Throughput*: Billed per GB of data transferred through the PrivateLink connection.
    - *Endpoint Charges*: Each PrivateLink endpoint incurs additional charges.

For detailed pricing information, refer to your billing dashboard or contact support.

## Best Practices for Reducing Network Cost

To optimize network usage and reduce costs in RisingWave Cloud, consider the following best practices:

- **Monitor and Analyze Network Usage**: Use the Metrics page in the cloud portal to track network usage and identify unexpected traffic in ingress and egress.
- **Use Compression**: Compress data before transferring to minimize network usage.
- **Leverage PrivateLink for Secure and Cost-Effective Transfers**: If connecting from AWS environments, use PrivateLink instead of public internet connections to reduce egress charges.
