## Pricing dimensions

RisingWave Cloud bills network usage based on two primary dimensions: **Public network traffic** and **PrivateLink usage**.

### 1. Public network traffic

Public network traffic charges are based on the volume of data (in gigabytes, GB) transferred over the public internet. This includes:

*   **Ingress (data entering RisingWave):**
    *   **Streaming data ingestion:** When you continuously ingest real-time data streams from external message brokers (like Kafka) or other sources into RisingWave.
    *   **Batch data imports:** When you use `INSERT ... SELECT` to pull data from external sources (like Kafka, S3, etc.) into RisingWave tables.
    *   **Note:** Data imported directly using client `INSERT` statements *is not* charged for ingress.

*   **Egress (data leaving RisingWave):**
    *   **Data export:** When you send processed data from RisingWave to external destinations, such as databases, message brokers, or other sinks.

### 2. PrivateLink usage

PrivateLink provides a secure and private connection between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and RisingWave Cloud, bypassing the public internet. This improves security and can reduce network costs.

**PrivateLink pricing:**

*   **PrivateLink endpoint hours:** You are billed per hour for each active PrivateLink endpoint.
*   **PrivateLink throughput:** You are billed per GB of data transferred through your PrivateLink connection.

For more details about how PrivateLink works in RisingWave Cloud, refer to the [PrivateLink Overview](/cloud/privatelink-overview).

## Pricing calculation

Network usage costs are calculated based on your actual consumption. Here's a detailed breakdown by cloud provider:

#### Example monthly cost calculation (AWS - US Regions)

| Usage                 | Calculation               | Cost    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Ingress: 100 GB       | 100 GB × $0.07/GB          | $7.00   |
| Egress: 50 GB        | 50 GB × $0.17/GB           | $8.50   |
| PrivateLink Hours: 720 | 720 hours × $0.03/hr       | $21.60  |
| PrivateLink Data: 150 GB   | 150 GB × $0.013/GB        | $1.95   |

## Best practices for reducing network costs

Here are some best practices to optimize your network usage and reduce costs in RisingWave Cloud:

*   **Monitor and analyze:** Use the Metrics page in the cloud portal to track your network usage and identify any unexpected traffic patterns (both ingress and egress).
*   **Use compression:** Compress your data before transferring it to minimize network usage.
*   **Leverage PrivateLink:** If you are connecting from an AWS environment, consider using PrivateLink instead of public internet connections. This can significantly reduce both ingress and egress charges and improve security.
