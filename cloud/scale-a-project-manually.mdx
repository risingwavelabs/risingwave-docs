title: "Scale a project manually"
description: "After creating a project, you have the flexibility to scale its resources and capacity to meet your specific data processing and analysis needs. This can be achieved through two methods: increasing or decreasing the number of worker nodes (horizontal scaling) or adjusting the resource capacity of each node in the project (vertical scaling)."
---

<Note>
You can scale the projects created in the Standard plan and the Advanced plan. The Trial plan has a fixed number of nodes and resources.
</Note>

## Scale your project

1. Navigate to the project overview page.
2. Click `...` menu on the right, and select **Rescale** to access the scaling options.

## Configure node resources

When scaling, you will configure the vCPU numbers for each component, with the memory size automatically scaling at a 1:4 ratio with the vCPUs. The [RWU](/cloud/pricing/#risingwave-unit-rwu) numbers are calculated based on the vCPU and memory size.

On the **Re-scale the project** page, click **Custom** to customize the configuration.
