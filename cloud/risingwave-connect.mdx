RisingWave Connect provides a unified, guided interface that organizes built‑in connectors into user‑friendly wizards. It streamlines connector configuration, filtering, and transformation, making it easier to build reliable real‑time data pipelines in RisingWave Cloud.

## Why choose Connect

Building streaming pipelines typically involves coordinating multiple systems, custom connector configuration, and managing schema evolution. Connect streamlines this workflow by:

- Providing a single place to manage all sources and sinks.

- Offering wizard-driven workflows that guide users through setup.

- Automatically generating and applying the correct SQL for connectors.

- Reducing the overhead required to move from initial setup to production.

With Connect, you can focus on data flow design rather than on infrastructure, connector APIs, or operational details.

## When to use Connect

Use Connect when you want to:

- Build real-time ingestion and delivery pipelines with minimal setup.

- Onboard new data systems quickly—without writing scripts or SQL manually.

- Create pipelines that primarily require direct replication or light transformations.

- Speed up development workflows or empower less experienced team members to set up data flows safely.

## Create a pipeline with Connect

To start using Connect in RisingWave Cloud:

1. Navigate to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) page and select a project.
2. In the left sidebar, click **RW Connect**.

Then you can create **Sources** to stream data into RisingWave and configure **Sinks** to deliver processed data to your desired destinations.

You can set up either component independently. For example, first create sources to stream operational data into RisingWave, build materialized views or transformations, and only later add sinks once they are ready to publish results externally.

## Set up sources

Connect your data sources to stream real-time data into RisingWave for processing and analysis. Supported sources include:

- PostgreSQL

- MySQL

- Kafka

- MongoDB

- SQL Server

When connecting a source, RisingWave provides a guided workflow that includes configuring connection, selecting tables and schemas, generating and executing SQL, and more.

Take PostgreSQL Source as an example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure & Test Connection">
    Enter the PostgreSQL connection details and test the connection to ensure RisingWave can access your source database.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tables & Schemas">
    Choose the schemas and tables from your PostgreSQL database that you want to replicate into RisingWave.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_2.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Columns & Types">
    Select specific columns, review data types, and define primary keys for your selected tables.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_3.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate & Execute SQL">
    Review the generated SQL statements and execute them to create the source in RisingWave.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_4.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once created, your source will begin streaming changes into RisingWave in real time.

## Set up sinks

Deliver your processed data to various destinations and downstream systems. Supported sinks include:

- Apache Iceberg

- Snowflake

- Elasticsearch

- PostgreSQL

- Amazon Redshift

- MySQL

- Kafka

- Amazon S3

For sinks, the workflow includes selecting tables, configuring sinks, reviewing, executing SQL, and more.

Take Amazon Redshift Sink as an example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Table Selection">
    Choose the tables from your database that you want to sink to Redshift. You can select multiple tables to create multiple sinks at once.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_1.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Configure the connection details and settings for your Redshift sink, including authentication, data mapping, and S3 intermediate staging.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_2.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Optimize performance settings and review your Redshift sink configuration.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_3.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once created, RisingWave continuously delivers data updates downstream with low latency.

## Next steps

With sources and sinks configured, your pipelines begin running immediately. From here you can:

- [Monitor pipeline status](/cloud/check-status-and-metrics) in the RisingWave Cloud UI.

- [Add materialized views](/cloud/monitor-materialized-views) to perform streaming transformations.

- Add new tables, schemas, or connectors as your system evolves.

- Modify or delete pipelines directly within RisingWave Connect.
