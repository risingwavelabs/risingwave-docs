RisingWave Cloud supports **Connect** function within the project to simplify the process of building and managing ETL pipelines. It reduces operational complexities and allows you to focus on setting up flows. You can connect to external sources and deliver results to sinks through one single interface.

## Why choose Connect

Traditionally, building data pipelines requires configuring multiple components, writing SQL or code, and managing complex dependencies. **Connect** simplifies this process by providing a unified, wizard-driven interface that abstracts away the underlying technical details. Instead of dealing with connector setup or orchestration logic, you can focus purely on defining your data flow.

By consolidating pipeline creation and management into a single, guided experience, **Connect** reduces operational overhead and shortens the time from idea to production. It enables teams to move faster, minimize errors, and deliver real-time insights without the need for deep infrastructure expertise.

## When to use Connect

**Connect** is ideal for straightforward data integration scenarios that do not require complex, multi-stage transformations. Whether you’re a beginner building your first pipeline or an expert who wants to move faster, it lowers the barrier to creating reliable real-time pipelines with minimal setup and maintenance.

## Create a pipeline with Connect

To start using Connect in RisingWave Cloud:

1. Navigate to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) page and select a project.
2. In the sidebar, click **RW Connect**.

Then you can create **Sources** to stream data into RisingWave and configure **Sinks** to deliver processed data to your desired destinations.

## Set up sources

Connect your data sources to stream real-time data into RisingWave for processing and analysis. Supported sources include:

- PostgreSQL

- MySQL

- Kafka

- MongoDB

- SQL Server

When connecting a source, RisingWave provides a guided workflow that includes configuring connection, selecting tables and schemas, generating and executing SQL, and more.

Take PostgreSQL Source as an example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure & Test Connection">
    Enter the PostgreSQL connection details and test the connection to ensure RisingWave can access your source database.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_1.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tables & Schemas">
    Choose the schemas and tables from your PostgreSQL database that you want to replicate into RisingWave.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_2.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Columns & Types">
    Select specific columns, review data types, and define primary keys for your selected tables.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_3.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate & Execute SQL">
    Review the generated SQL statements and execute them to create the source in RisingWave.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_pg_source_4.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up sinks

Deliver your processed data to various destinations and downstream systems. Supported sinks include:

- Apache Iceberg

- Snowflake

- Elasticsearch

- PostgreSQL

- Amazon Redshift

- MySQL

- Kafka

- Amazon S3

For sinks, the workflow includes selecting tables, configuring sinks, reviewing, executing SQL, and more.

Take Amazon Redshift Sink as an example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Table Selection">
    Choose the tables from your database that you want to sink to Redshift. You can select multiple tables to create multiple sinks at once.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_1.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Configure the connection details and settings for your Redshift sink, including authentication, data mapping, and S3 intermediate staging.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_2.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Optimize performance settings and review your Redshift sink configuration.
    <Frame><img src="/images/setup_redshift_sink_3.png" /></Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Once your sources and sinks are configured, your data pipelines are ready to run in real time. You can monitor the pipelines, make adjustments to transformations, or add new sources and sinks as needed.
