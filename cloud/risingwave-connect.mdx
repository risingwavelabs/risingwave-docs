RisingWave Cloud supports **Connect** function within the project to simplify the process of building and managing ETL pipelines. It reduces operational complexities and allows you to focus on setting up flows. You can connect to external sources and deliver results to sinks through one single interface.

This feature is ideal for straightforward data integration scenarios that do not require complex, multi-stage transformations. It makes it easier for users of all experience levels to set up pipelines quickly and process real-time data with minimal overhead.

## Create connect

To start using Connect in RisingWave Cloud:

1. Navigate to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) page and select a project.
2. In the sidebar, click **RW Connect**.

Then you can create **Sources** to stream data into RisingWave and configure **Sinks** to deliver processed data to your desired destinations.

## Set up sources

Connect your data sources to stream real-time data into RisingWave for processing and analysis. Supported sources include:

- PostgreSQL

- MySQL

- Kafka

- MongoDB

- SQL Server

When connecting a source, RisingWave provides a guided workflow that includes configuring connection, selecting tables and schemas, generating and executing SQL.

## Set up sinks

Deliver your processed data to various destinations and downstream systems. Supported sinks include:

- Apache Iceberg

- Snowflake

- Elasticsearch

- PostgreSQL

- Amazon Redshift

- MySQL

- Kafka

- Amazon S3

For sinks, the workflow includes selecting tables, configuring sinks, reviewing and executing SQL.

## Next steps

Once your sources and sinks are configured, your data pipelines are ready to run in real time. You can monitor the pipelines, make adjustments to transformations, or add new sources and sinks as needed.
