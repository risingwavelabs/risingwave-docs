---

RisingWave Cloud leverages the superpower of RisingWave, an open-source distributed SQL database specifically designed for stream processing. RisingWave provides an interface language that resembles PostgreSQL, enabling your team to build real-time data services without the high engineering cost and complexity of traditional stream processing.

## RisingWave user docs

Developers can refer to the user documentation for RisingWave to develop streaming applications with RisingWave Cloud. The documentation covers essential topics such as data ingestion, SQL references, data delivery, client libraries, and ecosystem, providing comprehensive information on how to utilize the capabilities of RisingWave to build and manage data workflows that consume streaming data, perform incremental computations, and update results dynamically.

## How to use the docs

RisingWave is a rapidly evolving system, with [new features](/release-notes/) added with each release. However, this also means some features may not function properly in older versions. Therefore, when using the RisingWave user docs, it's important to select the corresponding documentation version based on your RisingWave cluster's version.
