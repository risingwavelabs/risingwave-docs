## Concept

In RisingWave Cloud, an organization serves as the central entity that owns all resources, such as accounts, clusters, database objects, and VPC connections. Each organization provides all associated users with access to the same set of resources for seamless collaboration among them. When you sign up for RisingWave Cloud, an organization is automatically created for you. 

In an organization, you can:

- Share clusters, databases (and their tables, sources, sinks, and views), VPC connections, and other resources with all users.

- Allow users to manage the resources.

- Set up Single Sign-On (SSO).

- Set up service accounts for your applications that access RisingWave Cloud using API keys.
