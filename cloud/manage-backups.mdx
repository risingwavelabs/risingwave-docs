## Overview

A backup refers to the meta snapshot that captures the metadata serviceâ€™s state at a specific point in time. It allows you to:

- Restore lost data to your RisingWave cluster.
- Restore an instance to a previous state by using the backup to overwrite it.

## Backup cost

A meta snapshot pins data at a specific point in time in data storage, preventing it from being recycled by compaction. As a result, they may increase overall storage usage. Backups are billed at the standard storage rate.

## Backup types

RisingWave supports the following types of backups:

- **On-demand backups**: You can create a snapshot at any time, such as before performing a risky operation on your database. On-demand backups persist until you delete them, or until their associated project is deleted. Since they are not automatically deleted, on-demand backups can have a long-term effect on your billing charges.

- **Automated backups**: Automated backups are created at regular intervals for all tenants. By default, a new backup is created every 30 minutes, but only the three most recent backups are retained. Older backups are automatically deleted on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

## Create and manage backups

To create an on-demand backup:
    1. Navigate to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) page and select a project.
    2. In the sidebar, click **Backup**.
    3. In the top left, click **Add one-time backup** to create an on-demand backup.

Automated backups are created every 30 minutes and do not require any manual action.

From the backup interface, you can create and view snapshots.

To manage existing snapshots, hover over its entry to reveal the **Restore** and **Delete** options on the right.

## Restoration

Restoring a tenant from a snapshot creates a new, independent tenant that replicates the state of the original at the time of the snapshot. This includes all sources, sinks, materialized views, and related configurations.

Upon successful restoration, the original tenant is automatically quiesced (i.e., transitioned into a frozen state) to prevent data consistency issues, such as concurrent writes from multiple tenants to the same downstream sink.

Administrators can choose to either delete the original tenant or resume its operation. However, running both the original and restored tenants concurrently is **NOT** encouraged unless proper isolation is ensured, as this may lead to undefined or conflicting behavior.
