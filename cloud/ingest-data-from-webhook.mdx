description: "Use managed webhook endpoints in RisingWave Cloud to ingest webhook events directly into your project."

This guide covers webhook ingestion for **managed RisingWave Cloud** projects, where requests are routed through the managed `rwproxy` webhook endpoint.

<Info>
If you are running self-hosted RisingWave (Operator/Helm/bare metal), use [Ingest data from webhook](/integrations/sources/webhook).
</Info>

## How managed webhook routing works

In managed RisingWave Cloud, webhook requests are accepted by `rwproxy` over HTTPS and forwarded to your project's frontend webhook listener.

- Public ingress: HTTPS `:443`
- Webhook path format: `/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<table>`

Tenant routing:

1. Hosted projects: SNI hostname first, then `tenant` query parameter fallback.
2. BYOC projects: currently use `tenant` query parameter (SNI is not supported).

## Prerequisites

1. A running RisingWave Cloud project.
2. The tenant identifier of your project (for example, `rwc-g1huxxxxxx-mycluster`).
3. A webhook table in your target database/schema (you can create it in the wizard).

For details on tenant identifier and project connection details, see [Connection errors](/cloud/connection-errors).

<Warning>
Current BYOC limitations:
- SNI is not supported yet. Use `?tenant=<tenant identifier>` in the webhook URL.
- TLS certificate verification may fail unless verification is disabled on the sender side. For testing, you can temporarily disable TLS verification in your client (for example, use `curl -k`).
</Warning>

## Hosted vs BYOC requirements

| Project type | Tenant routing requirement | TLS note |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hosted | Use the webhook endpoint generated by the wizard. Hosted projects support SNI routing, with query-parameter fallback. | Use standard TLS verification. |
| BYOC | Use the webhook endpoint generated by the wizard, which includes `?tenant=<tenant identifier>`. BYOC currently does not support SNI routing. | TLS verification can fail in some BYOC environments. For testing, use `curl -k` (or client equivalent). |

## Use the Cloud Portal webhook wizard (recommended)

Use the wizard as the primary setup path so users do not need to manually construct hostnames or endpoint URLs.

Wizard steps:

1. Open your project workspace and go to **Connect Your Data**.
2. Open **Webhook Configuration**.
3. Select **Database**, **Schema**, and **Table**.
4. (Optional) Use **Create new webhook table** to generate SQL, preview it, and run it.
5. Copy the generated **Webhook Endpoint URL**.
6. Expand **cURL Example** and copy the generated command.

## Recommended SQL and cURL commands

Use these as reference commands. In practice, prefer the wizard-generated SQL and endpoint values.

**Create webhook table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE wbhtable (
  data JSONB
) WITH (
  connector = 'webhook'
) VALIDATE AS secure_compare(
  headers->>'signature',
  '1'
);
```

For provider-specific validation examples (GitHub, Segment, HubSpot, EventBridge, RudderStack), see [Webhook integrations](/integrations/sources/webhook#supported-webhook-sources-and-authentication-methods).

**Hosted projects cURL example**

```bash
curl -i -X POST "<webhook_endpoint_url_from_wizard>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "signature: 1" \
  -d '{"event":"user.signup","user_id":"123"}'
```

**BYOC projects cURL example**

```bash
curl -k -i -X POST "<webhook_endpoint_url_from_wizard>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "signature: 1" \
  -d '{"event":"user.signup","user_id":"123"}'
```

<Warning>
The webhook path must be exactly `/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<table>`.
</Warning>

**Verify ingestion**

```sql
SELECT * FROM wbhtable;
```
