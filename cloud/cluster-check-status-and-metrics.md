You can check and monitor your clusters' overall running status and detailed metrics.

## Check the overall condition

<grid
 container
 direction="row"
 spacing="20"
 justifyContent="space-between"
 justifyItems="stretch"
 alignItems="baseline">

<grid item xs={6} md={6}>

To check the overall condition of the clusters in your account, go to [**Dashboard**](https://risingwave.cloud/dashboard/).
    
In **Dashboard**, you can get an overview of the clusters in your account, including the number of clusters, their plan selections, and running statuses. You can also click on a cluster to check its running metrics.

</grid>

<grid item xs={6} md={6}>

To browse each cluster's configuration and running status in your account, go to [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/).
    
In **Clusters**, you can see all the clusters in your account and [control their running states](cluster-stop-and-delete-clusters.md). You can also check the current plan, RisingWave Database version, region, and creation time of each cluster here.

## Check cluster details

To enter the cluster details page and check the information, such as current activities and resource usage, and monitor all metrics of a cluster, go to [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/) and click on the cluster.

The cluster details page includes:

- Materialized views
- Database users
