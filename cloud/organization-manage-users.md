Users in an organization can access the same set of resources for seamless collaboration. As the organization owner, you can invite others to join your organization as member users and share resources among them.

An organization can have one owner and multiple member users.

- The owner can [invite others to join the organization](#invite-users-to-join-your-organization) and [manage users in the organization](#manage-users-in-your-organization). The owner shares all resources, including clusters and databases, with the organization. You become the owner of your organization when you [sign up](https://cloud.risingwave.com/signup) for RisingWave Cloud by yourself, not through an invitation.

- A member user can access all the resources in the organization that the owner shares. A member user can also invite others to join the organization and manage them but cannot remove the owner from the organization. You become a member user when you [accept an invitation](#accept-invitation-to-join-an-organization-as-a-member) to join an organization.

## Invite users to join your organization

You can invite others to create a RisingWave Cloud account and join your organization. The invited users have **one day** to confirm and join.

4. Click **Send invite**.

The invited user will receive an email with a link to sign up and join this organization. Remind the user to check the junk folder if not getting the email in the inbox.

If the invitation expires, you can click **Resend** to renew the invitation and send the email again.

After the user joins, you can see the user in the **Users** tab.

## Accept invitation to join an organization (as a member)

After the organization owner sends the invitation, the invited user should receive an email.

Click **Accept Invite** within one day and fill in your information and account password to sign up for RisingWave Cloud and join the organization.

After you join an organization, you'll have full access to the resources and database objects in the organization. You can also invite others to join the organization.
