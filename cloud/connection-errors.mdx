## Failed to get tenant identifier

To connect to a project, you need to provide the tenant identifier. The tenant identifier is a global unique identifier for each project, and the format of the tenant identifier is `rwc-g1huxxxxxx-mycluster`. You can find the tenant identifier in the RisingWave Cloud console.

Below are 3 ways to put the tenant identifier in the connection string.

### Solution 1: Put the tenant identifier in the `options` field

```bash
psql "postgresql://<username>:@<hostname>:<port>/<database?options=--tenant%3D<tenant identifier>"
```

`%3D` is the URL encoded form of `=`. If the client does not require URL encoding, you can use `--tenant=<tenant identifier>` directly.

<Note>
Not all clients support the `options` field. If your client does not support the `options` field, you can use solution 2 or 3.
</Note>

### Solution 2: Put the tenant identifier in the host

You can put the tenant identifier in the host in the format of `<tenant identifier>.<hostname>`. This solution is only available when the client supports SNI routing and the connection is secured by TLS.

```bash
psql "postgresql://<username>:@<tenant identifier>.<hostname>:<port>/<database?sslmode=verify-full"
```

<Note>
Not all clients support SNI routing. If your client does not support SNI routing, you can use solution 1 or 3.
</Note>

### Solution 3: Put the tenant identifier in the username[](#solution-3-put-the-tenant-identifier-in-the-username "Direct link to Solution 3: Put the tenant identifier in the username")

You can also put the tenant identifier in the username in the format of `<tenant identifier>;<username>`. This solution is available for all clients.

```bash
psql "postgresql://<tenant identifier>;<username>:@<hostname>:<port>/<database?sslmode=verify-full"
```

<Note>
The server will use `AuthenticationCleartextPassword` response to authenticate the user. Learn more about the protocol in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html).
</Note>

## The tenant identifier is not specified

This error occurs when your Postgres client doesn't support Server Name Indication (SNI), so it can't automatically send the tenant identifier needed to route your request correctly.

RisingWave Cloud has tested the following drivers for SNI support:

| Driver     | Language | SNI support | Note                                         |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| psycopg2   | Python   | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid"/> | Requires the 'sslmode': 'require' option     |
| asyncpg    | Python   | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid"/>           | Requires the 'sslmode': 'verify-full' option |
| SQLAlchemy | Python   | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid"/>          | Requires the 'sslmode': 'require' option     |

## SSL error

When you see errors like `SSL error: certificate verify failed`, `root certificate file xxx does not exist`, or `no certificate or crl found`, it means the client cannot verify the certificate of the server. To fix this error, you need to download the root certificate of RisingWave Cloud and put it in the correct location.

### Mac/Linux

```bash
curl -L --create-dirs -o $HOME/.postgresql/root.crt 'https://risingwave.cloud/rootca/root.crt'
```

### Windows

```bash
mkdir -p $env:appdata\postgresql\; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://risingwave.cloud/rootca/root.crt
```

## Instance is currently unavailable

This error occurs when the project is not available. You can check the status of the project in the RisingWave Cloud console. If the project is running, you can try to reconnect to the project.

## Still having connection issues?

If you've tried the solutions above and are still experiencing connection problems:
