title: "Manage sources"
description: "To ingest data into RisingWave, you must first create a source. A source refers to an external data feed that RisingWave can read from. You can connect RisingWave to a variety of external sources like databases and message brokers. After a source is connected, you can create materialized views to perform analysis or sinks for data transformations."

2. Specify the project and click its **Workspace**.
3. Next to **Source** tab, click **\+ Add new**.
4. Select the service you want to connect to.

## Drop a source

If you no longer require data from a source, drop the source connection with one of the following methods to stop data consumption.

### Using guided step
