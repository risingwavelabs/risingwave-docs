## What to expect during upgrade

Hereâ€™s what you should know about the upgrade:

* RisingWave Cloud automatically backs up your data before the upgrade begins
* During the upgrade process:
  * Project operations will be temporarily unavailable
  * Streaming pipelines will be halted and experience a temporary downtime
  * Query Serving, being more lightweight, will typically recover faster than streaming pipelines
  * You won't be charged for compute resources during this period

## How to upgrade

Upgrading your RisingWave version is simple:

1. Go to [**Project**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/)
2. Click the rocket icon next to the project you want to upgrade
3. Wait for the upgrade to complete (this typically takes a few minutes)

<Note>
You can only upgrade to newer versions of RisingWave. Downgrading to previous versions is not supported.
