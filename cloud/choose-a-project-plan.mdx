Each project type is associated with the corresponding features, capabilities, restrictions, and pricing models. Please choose a project plan and configure project resources according to your needs when creating a project.

## Project types

For the up-to-date plans and the pricing information, please see [the Pricing page](https://risingwave.com/pricing/).

## Configuration

* **Cloud platform**
You can deploy your project on either AWS or Google Cloud, depending on your cloud provider preferences.
* **Region**
You can choose the availability region closest to you to minimize latency.
* **Project name**
Name of the project. Assigning a descriptive name to each project can be helpful when managing multiple projects.
* **Node configuration**
Configure each node's instance resources and numbers according to your actual needs.
To learn more about the nodes, see the [architecture of RisingWave](/get-started/architecture).

## Understanding nodes in RisingWave

RisingWave projects consist of four types of nodes, each serving a distinct role:

1. **Serving Node**: Responsible for parsing and validating queries, executing batch queries, optimizing streaming query plans, and delivering query results.
2. **Streaming Node**: Responsible for ingesting data from upstream systems, parsing and running streaming queries, and optionally delivering data to downstream systems.
3. **Compactor Node**: Handles data storage and retrieval from object storage. They also perform data compaction to optimize storage efficiency.
4. **Meta Node**: Takes charge of managing the metadata of compute and Compactor Nodes and orchestrating operations across the system.
5. **ETCD**: A distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a project of machines. This node cannot be scaled manually after the project is created.
