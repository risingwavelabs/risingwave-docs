## Understanding nodes in RisingWave

RisingWave projects consist of three types of nodes, each serving a distinct role:

1. **Compute node**: Responsible for ingesting data from upstream systems, parsing and running SQL queries, and delivering data to downstream systems.
2. **Frontend node**: Responsible for parsing and validating queries, optimizing query execution plans, and delivering query results.
3. **Compactor node**: Handles data storage and retrieval from object storage. They also perform data compaction to optimize storage efficiency.
4. **Meta node**: Takes charge of managing the metadata of compute and compactor nodes and orchestrating operations across the system.
5. **ETCD**: A distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a project of machines. This node cannot be scaled manually after the project is created.

For the architecture of RisingWave, see [RisingWave architecture](/reference/architecture).
