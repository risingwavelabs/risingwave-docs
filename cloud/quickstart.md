## Create a cluster

A cluster in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a cluster, you can create and manage database users and databases.

You can find the **Create cluster** button on the [home page](https://cloud.risingwave.com/dashboard/) or the [**Clusters**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/clusters/) tab after your first login.
<p></p>

You can choose to create a free cluster or a customizable cluster if you have an invitation code.

See [Choose a cluster plan](cluster-choose-a-cluster-plan.md) for details on how to choose a cluster plan and configure the resources.

<TabItem value="3" label="3. Connect to your cluster">

## Connect to your cluster

After getting a cluster up and running, you need to connect to it so that you can interact with RisingWave.

You can choose from the following two ways to connect to your cluster.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="console" label="Query console">

The query console is the most intuitive and easy way to connect to and interact with RisingWave, offering graphical tools for managing data and visualizing results.


#### To connect via the console:


1. Go to [**Query**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/console/).  

2. Create a new database user.

    > You must log in to the cluster as a database user. Since this is a new cluster, you need to create a user in it first.

    <img

    alt="Create a database user"
    />

3. Enter the password of the user you created to log in to the cluster.

    alt="First login to the console"
    />

</TabItem>
 
<TabItem value="local" label="Local client">

For terminal enthusiasts, you can still connect to your cluster through a local terminal with the help of `psql`.

#### To connect via `psql` client:

1. [Install `psql`](/docs/current/install-psql-without-postgresql/) in your environment.

    `psql` is a command-line interface for interacting with PostgreSQL databases, including RisingWave.

2. In RisingWave Cloud, go to [**Clusters**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/clusters/).
    
3. Click **Connect** of your cluster.

4. Create a new database user.
    
    > You must connect and log in to the cluster as a database user. Since this is a new cluster, you need to create a user in it first.

    alt="Create a database user in a cluster"
    />
    
5. Copy the connection string and run it in a terminal window.
    
6. Log in with the password of the database user.

## Explore RisingWave with examples

You can kickstart your journey with RisingWave by exploring the sample queries in the [**Query**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/console/) console.

These demos cover the most common steps in using RisingWave, such as establishing a connection with a data source, processing data by defining materialized views, and querying the results.
