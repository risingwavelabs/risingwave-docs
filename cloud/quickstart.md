Get started with RisingWave Cloud in 5 steps.

## Step 1: Create an account

You can use your company email to create an account.

1. [Sign up](https://cloud.risingwave.com/auth/signup/) for RisingWave Cloud.

2. [Log in](https://cloud.risingwave.com/auth/signin/) to your account.

Alternatively, continue with your third-party account: **Google**, **Microsoft**, or **Github**.

## Step 2: Create a project

After you sign up, you are navigated to **Create project** on the [home page](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/). A project in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a project, you can create and manage database users and databases.

You can choose to create a free project or a customizable project if you have an invitation code. See [Choose a project plan](project-choose-a-project-plan.md) to decide on a project and configure the resources.

## Step 3: Connect to your project

After getting a project up and running, you need to connect to it so that you can interact with RisingWave.

Choose from the following ways to connect to your project.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Workspace" label="Workspace">

Workspace offers graphical tools for managing data and visualizing results. It is the most intuitive and easy way to connect to and interact with RisingWave.

#### To connect via workspace, follow the steps below:

1. In RisingWave Cloud, go to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/), and click **Workspace** for the project you want to connect to.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="local" label="Local client">

If you need to connect to the RisingWave project via local clients, you can configure the connection in multiple ways.

#### To connect with any local clients, follow the steps below:

1. In RisingWave Cloud, go to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/), and click **Connect** for the project you want to connect to.

2. Click **Switch** in the top right corner to switch users, and then choose a startup mode.

3. You may need to set up a CA certificate to enable SSL connections. See the instructions displayed on the portal for more details.

4. Copy the command and run it in a terminal window.

5. Log in with the password of the database user.

For detailed instructions, see [Local client](project-connect-to-a-project.md#local-client).
