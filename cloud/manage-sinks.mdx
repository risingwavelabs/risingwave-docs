title: "Manage sinks"
description: "To stream data out of RisingWave, you must create a sink. A sink refers to an external target that you can send data to. You can deliver data to downstream systems via our sink connectors."
---

For the complete list of supported sink connectors and data formats, see [Data delivery](/delivery/overview) in the RisingWave documentation.

## Create a sink

You can create a sink using SQL command to deliver processed data to an external target.

<Note>
**Data Security**
- All data ingested through sources or sinks is encrypted in transit using TLS
- Data stored within RisingWave is encrypted at rest:
  - AWS S3: Using AWS default encryption keys
  - EBS volumes: Using KMS managed keys with automatic rotation
</Note>


Refer to [CREATE SINK](/sql/commands/sql-create-sink) in the RisingWave Database documentation.

## Check a sink

1. Go to [**Project**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/).
2. Specify the project and click its **Workspace**.
3. Click **Sink** tab to view sinks.

## Drop a sink

If you no longer need to deliver data to a sink, you can drop the sink using SQL command.

Refer to [DROP SINK](/sql/commands/sql-drop-sink) in the RisingWave Database documentation.
