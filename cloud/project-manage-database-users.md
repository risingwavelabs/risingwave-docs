In RisingWave, a database user is similar to a database user or role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a project. Also, you [connect and log in to a project](project-connect-to-a-project.md) as one of its database users. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges. Currently, all database users have the superuser privilege. Future releases will introduce more granular permissions.
