<Note>
**Security and Encryption**
- All connections are automatically encrypted using TLS/SSL
- For AWS PrivateLink connections:
  - Data in transit is encrypted using AWS internal network encryption
  - Any data stored in S3 is encrypted at rest using AWS default encryption keys
  - EBS volumes are encrypted using KMS managed keys with automatic key rotation
</Note>

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
When setting up AWS PrivateLink services, do not use the AWS account root user. Always use IAM users or roles with appropriate permissions following AWS security best practices.
</Warning>

* You need to create a project with the Standard plan or Advanced plan in RisingWave Cloud:
   * See [Choose a project plan](/cloud/choose-a-project-plan/) for more information. Please note that Trial projects do not support PrivateLink connections.
   * The VPC you want to connect to and your project must be in the same region. If your preferred region is not available when creating a project, contact our [support team](mailto:cloud-support@risingwave-labs.com) or [sales team](mailto:sales@risingwave-labs.com).
* You need to set up a PrivateLink service in your VPC and make sure it runs properly. The following links might be helpful:
   * For AWS, see [Share your services through AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-share-your-services.html).
   * For GCP, see [GCP Published services](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/about-vpc-hosted-services).
   * For Azure, see [Azure Private Link services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview).

## Steps

1. Go to the [**Project**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) page and select the project you want to connect the VPC to.
2. Select **PrivateLink** tab, and click **Create PrivateLink**.
3. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the connection.
4. For **Endpoint service name** or **Service attachment** or **Private link service resource ID:**

5. Click **Confirm** to create the connection.

<Tip>
For inquiries about PrivateLink for Confluent private Kafka clusters, please reach out to our [support team](mailto:cloud-support@risingwave-labs.com) first. We will handle these manual steps:

* Before provisioning a RisingWave PrivateLink, ensure the cluster's Availability Zones (AZs) are a subset of the AZs offered by RisingWave.
* Manually add DNS records after provisioning the PrivateLink.

We aim to automate this process in the future to make it even easier.
</Tip>

## What's next

Now, you can create a source or sink with the PrivateLink connection using SQL.

For details on how to use the VPC endpoint to create a source with the PrivateLink connection, see [Create source with PrivateLink connection](/integrations/sources/kafka#create-source-with-privatelink-connection); for creating a sink, see [Create sink with PrivateLink connection](/integrations/destinations/apache-kafka#create-sink-with-privatelink-connection).
