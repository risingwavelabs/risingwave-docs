title: "PrivateLink connection"
sidebarTitle: Overview
description: In RisingWave Cloud, if you want to connect RisingWave instances with your services inside your private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, you can use the PrivateLink service to establish a private and secure connection between RisingWave Cloud and your private VPC in the same region.
---
RisingWave Cloud utilizes the private connection capability of the underlying Cloud vendors to establish the PrivateLink connection. In particular, the PrivateLink service is built on top of the following services:

* [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html)
<Note>
When configuring AWS PrivateLink, ensure you're using an IAM user or role with appropriate permissions. Never use the AWS account root user for these operations.
</Note>
* [GCP Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect)
* [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/)

<Note>
Azure Private Link integration is currently in development and will be available soon.
</Note>


The diagram below depicts a high-level overview of how PrivateLink service works. All three platforms share the same pattern of network structure so that you can configure them in the same way automatically.

<Info>
All data transmitted through PrivateLink connections is automatically encrypted in transit. Additionally:
- For AWS PrivateLink: Communication is secured using AWS's internal network and TLS encryption
- For GCP Private Service Connect: Data is encrypted using Google's internal network encryption
- For Azure Private Link: Traffic is automatically encrypted within the Microsoft backbone network
</Info>

On the **RisingWave Cloud** side, RisingWave Cloud will create an endpoint (specifically an AWS VPC endpoint, GCP Private Service Connect endpoint, or Azure private endpoint) and bind it with one running RisingWave project.

On the **Customer** side, you need to set up a PrivateLink service (specifically an AWS endpoint service, GCP published service, or Azure Private Link service) in your VPC network first.
