RisingWave supports multiple deployment modes, each designed for different use cases and environments. This guide helps you choose the right option quickly.

## How to choose (quick checklist)

- **Just want to try RisingWave locally?** Use **Standalone mode**.
- **Need production reliability with minimal ops?** Use **[RisingWave Cloud](/deploy/risingwave-cloud)**.

## Quick comparison

| Deployment option | Time to deploy | Production use? | Best for | Documentation |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **Standalone mode** (Script, Docker, or Homebrew) | < 5 minutes | No | Learning, development, quick experiments | [Standalone mode](/operate/rw-standalone-mode) |
| **RisingWave Cloud** | < 5 minutes | Yes | Managed production deployments | [RisingWave Cloud](/deploy/risingwave-cloud) |
| **Docker Compose** | < 5 minutes | No (testing only) | Local testing with bundled services | [Docker Compose](/deploy/risingwave-docker-compose) |
| **Kubernetes (Helm)** | ~30 minutes | Yes | Self-managed production deployments (simpler) | [Kubernetes (Helm)](/deploy/risingwave-k8s-helm) |
| **Kubernetes (Operator)** | ~30 minutes | Yes | Self-managed production deployments (more automation) | [Kubernetes (Operator)](/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes) |

## Recommendations

### Quick start and development

**Recommended: Standalone mode**

Best for learning, development, and quick testing. It runs as a single process and gets you started in minutes.

### Production environments

**Recommended: RisingWave Cloud** (managed) or **Kubernetes** (self-managed)

- **RisingWave Cloud**: Fully managed. Best when you want production reliability without infrastructure management.
- **Kubernetes**: Self-managed. Best when you need full control and already operate Kubernetes in production.

### Testing and single-machine deployment

**Recommended: Docker Compose**

Easy setup for local testing with multiple services. Not recommended for production.
