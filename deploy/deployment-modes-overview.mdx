### Quick start and development

**Recommended: Standalone mode**

Best for learning, development, and testing. Get started in under 5 minutes with a single process.

### Production environments

**Recommended: RisingWave Cloud** (managed service) or **Kubernetes** (self-managed)

- **RisingWave Cloud**: Fully managed service, fastest setup, no infrastructure management
- **Kubernetes**: Self-managed, full control, scalable and resilient
