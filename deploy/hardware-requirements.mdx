## Supported architectures

RisingWave can run on the following hardware architectures:

* x86\_64 (64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs)
* ARM64
* Mac with Apple Silicon


<Note>
The docker images for `x86_64` are built with AVX2 SIMD extensions, and the images for `aarch64` (ARM64) are built with NEON SIMD extensions. These must be supported by your machine. If not, build the docker image with the build-arg `simd_disabled=true`.

- To build the images, run the following from the project root: `docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile`.
- To build the images without SIMD vector extensions, run the following from the project root `docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg simd_disabled=true` and run any subsequent docker commands on the resultant image.

## Compute nodes

Compute nodes handle query processing and state management. More resources enable higher query throughput. For cost efficiency, machines with high memory-to-CPU ratios (4:1 or higher) are recommended due to RisingWave's memory-intensive nature.

* Minimum:
   * 2 CPU cores
   * 8 GB memory
* Recommended:
   * ≥4 CPU cores
   * ≥16 GB memory

## Compactor nodes

Compactor nodes perform background compaction jobs to optimize state storage. Insufficient resources for compactors will result in slow state access and impact overall performance.

* Minimum:
   * 1 CPU core
   * 1 GB memory
* Recommended:
   * ≥2 CPU cores
   * ≥2 GB memory

## Meta nodes

Meta nodes manage metadata and coordinate the cluster. It is advisable to deploy 2 meta nodes (primary and backup) to ensure faster recovery and avoid single points of failure (SPOF).

* Minimum:
   * 1 CPU core
   * 1 GB memory
* Recommended:
   * ≥2 CPU cores
   * ≥4 GB memory

## Storage

RisingWave offers support for multiple storage systems as storage backends. For the complete list of supported storage systems for Kubernetes deployments, see [Set up a RisingWave cluster in Kubernetes](/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes#deploy-a-risingwave-instance).

Please notice that storage performance can **significantly** impact RisingWave's performance. We recommend using high-performance cloud storage systems such as AWS S3\. For self-managed storage systems such as MinIO or local file system, please ensure to use high-performance SSD disks.
