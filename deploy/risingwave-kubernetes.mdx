**NOTE**

The following errors might occur if `cert-manager` is not fully initialized. Simply wait for another minute and rerun the command above.
```bash
Error from server (InternalError): Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "webhook.cert-manager.io": failed to call webhook: Post "<https://cert-manager-webhook.cert-manager.svc:443/mutate?timeout=10s>": dial tcp 10.105.102.32:443: connect: connection refused
```
</Info>
  </Step>
  <Step>
_**Optional:**_ Check if the Pods are running.

```bash
kubectl -n cert-manager get pods
kubectl -n risingwave-operator-system get pods
```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Deploy a RisingWave instance

RisingWave Kubernetes Operator extends the Kubernetes with CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) to manage RisingWave. That means all you need to do is to create a RisingWave resource in your Kubernetes cluster, and the RisingWave Kubernetes Operator will take care of the rest.

### Use the example resource files

The RisingWave resource is a custom resource that defines a RisingWave cluster. In [this directory](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/blob/main/docs/manifests/risingwave), you can find resource examples that deploy RisingWave with different configurations of metadata store and state backend. Based on your requirements, you can use these resource files directly or as a reference for your customization. The [stable directory](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/tree/main/docs/manifests/stable/) contains resource files that we have tested compatibility with the latest released version of the RisingWave Operator:

The resource files are named using the convention of `risingwave-<meta_store>-<state_backend>.yaml`. For example, `risingwave-postgresql-s3.yaml` means that this manifest file uses PostgreSQL as the meta storage and AWS S3 as the state backend.

RisingWave supports using these systems or services as state backends.

* MinIO
* AWS S3
* S3-compatible object storages
* Google Cloud Storage
* Azure Blob Storage
* Alibaba Cloud OSS
* HDFS

You can [customize the state backend](#optional-customize-the-state-backend), or [customize the state store directory](#optional-customize-the-state-store-directory).

### Optional: Customize the state backend
#### Download source file

If you intend to customize a resource file, download the file to a local path and edit it:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/main/docs/manifests/<sub-directory> -o risingwave.yaml

```

You can also create your own resource file from scratch if you are familiar with Kubernetes resource files.

Then, apply the resource file by using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f a.yaml      # relative path
kubectl apply -f /tmp/a.yaml # absolute path

```

#### Customize the state backends

To customize the state backend of your RisingWave cluster, edit the `spec:stateStore` section under the RisingWave resource (`kind: RisingWave`).

<Tabs>
 <Tab title="AWS S3">
```yaml
spec:
  stateStore:
    # Prefix to objects in the object stores or directory in file system. Default to "hummock".
    dataDirectory: hummock

    # Declaration of the S3 state store backend.
    s3:
      # Region of the S3 bucket.
      region: us-east-1

      # Name of the S3 bucket.
      bucket: risingwave

      # Credentials to access the S3 bucket.
      credentials:

```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MinIO">
<Info>
**NOTE**

The performance of MinIO is closely tied to the disk performance of the node where it is hosted. We have observed that AWS EBS does not perform well in our tests. For optimal performance, we recommend using S3 or a compatible cloud service.

</Tab>
<Tab title="HDFS">
#### Customize HDFS as state backend

To customize HDFS as state backend in RisingWave, mount Hadoop configurations with ConfigMap.

1. Firstly, prepare the config files locally like below, make sure the entire directory are mounted as a Config Map.

```bash
ls $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop
core-site.xml hdfs-site.xml

```

1. Next, create a ConfigMap, where `hadoop-conf` is the name of ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl create configmap hadoop-conf --from-file $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop

```

1. Then mount the Hadoop configuration files using this ConfigMap:

Replace the following placeholders:

* `<your-risingwave-image-name>`: The name of your RisingWave Docker image.
* `<your-hadoop-namenode-address>`: The address of your Hadoop NameNode.
* `<your-hadoop-data-directory>`: The directory where data is stored.

Note that the value of the `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` environment variable and the path where the `hadoop-conf` ConfigMap is mounted should be identical.

#### Customize HDFS client

You can also customize the HDFS client as needed. We have built an image based on Hadoop 2.7.3\. If you want to create your own RisingWave image, please adjust the Hadoop configuration according to your specific cluster information and ensure that:

* The `CLASSPATH` is correctly set.
* `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` is placed at the beginning of the `CLASSPATH`.

See [Docker file for HDFS](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.hdfs) for the latest version.

Then build the image and push it to somewhere. Make sure it’s reachable by the Kubernetes clusters or the machine running docker.
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Optional: Customize the state store directory

You can customize the directory for storing state data via the `spec: stateStore: dataDirectory` parameter in the `risingwave.yaml` file that you want to use to deploy a RisingWave instance. If you have multiple RisingWave instances, ensure the value of `dataDirectory` for the new instance is unique (the default value is `hummock`). Otherwise, the new RisingWave instance may crash. Save the changes to the `risingwave.yaml` file before running the `kubectl apply -f <...risingwave.yaml>` command. The directory path cannot be an absolute address, such as `/a/b`, and must be no longer than 180 characters.

### Validate the status of the instance

You can check the status of the RisingWave instance by running the following command.

```bash
kubectl get risingwave

```

If the instance is running properly, the output should look like this:

```bash
NAME        RUNNING   STORAGE(META)   STORAGE(OBJECT)   AGE
risingwave  True      postgresql      S3                30s

```

## Connect to RisingWave
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ClusterIP">
By default, the Operator creates a service for the frontend component, through which you can interact with RisingWave, with the type of `ClusterIP`. But it is not accessible outside Kubernetes. Therefore, you need to create a standalone Pod for PostgreSQL inside Kubernetes.

**Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Pod.">
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator/main/docs/manifests/psql/psql-console.yaml
```
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Attach to the Pod so that you can execute commands inside the container.">
```bash
kubectl exec -it psql-console -- bash
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to RisingWave via `psql`.">
```bash
psql -h risingwave-frontend -p 4567 -d dev -U root
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="NodePort">
You can connect to RisingWave from Nodes such as EC2 in Kubernetes

**Steps:**

1. In the `risingwave.yaml` file that you use to deploy the RisingWave instance, add a `frontendServiceType` parameter to the configuration of the RisingWave service, and set its value to `NodePort`.
```bash
# ...
kind: RisingWave
...
spec:
  frontendServiceType: NodePort
# ...
```
2. Connect to RisingWave by running the following commands on the Node.
```bash
export RISINGWAVE_NAME=risingwave-postgresql-hdfs
export RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE=default
export RISINGWAVE_HOST=`kubectl -n ${RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE} get node -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'`
export RISINGWAVE_PORT=`kubectl -n ${RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE} get svc -l risingwave/name=${RISINGWAVE_NAME},risingwave/component=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.ports[0].nodePort}'`
psql -h ${RISINGWAVE_HOST} -p ${RISINGWAVE_PORT} -d dev -U root
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LoadBalancer">
If you are using EKS, GCP, or other managed Kubernetes services provided by cloud vendors, you can expose the Service to the public network with a load balancer in the cloud.

**Steps:**

1. In the `risingwave.yaml` file that you use to deploy the RisingWave instance, add a `frontendServiceType` parameter to the configuration of the RisingWave service, and set its value to `LoadBalancer`.
```bash
# ...
kind: RisingWave
...
spec:
  frontendServiceType: LoadBalancer
# ...
```
2. Connect to RisingWave with the following commands.
```bash
export RISINGWAVE_NAME=risingwave-postgresql-hdfs
export RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE=default
export RISINGWAVE_HOST=`kubectl -n ${RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE} get svc -l risingwave/name=${RISINGWAVE_NAME},risingwave/component=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`
export RISINGWAVE_PORT=`kubectl -n ${RISINGWAVE_NAMESPACE} get svc -l risingwave/name=${RISINGWAVE_NAME},risingwave/component=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.ports[0].port}'`
psql -h ${RISINGWAVE_HOST} -p ${RISINGWAVE_PORT} -d dev -U root
```
  </Tab>
