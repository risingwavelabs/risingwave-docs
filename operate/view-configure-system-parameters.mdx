## What are system parameters?

System parameters in RisingWave refer to the parameters that advanced users can use to adjust how internal components work in RisingWave.

Currently, these system parameters are available in RisingWave.

| Parameter                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| adaptive_parallelism_strategy | The strategy for adaptive parallelism. Can be modified by [`ALTER SYSTEM`](/sql/commands/sql-alter-system) command. <ul><li>When set to `Full`, the job will use all available parallelism;</li><li>When set to `Bounded(n)`, the maximum parallelism is limited to `n`;</li><li>When set to `Ratio(r)`, the actual available parallelism will be multiplied by `r` (rounded down).</li></ul> All parallelism is still subject to the limits of max parallelism and resource groups. |
| barrier\_interval\_ms                      | The time interval of the periodic barriers. Since v2.5.0, this setting can also be configured per-database for finer control over latency and resource usage. See [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/commands/sql-create-database) for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| checkpoint\_frequency                      | Specify the number of barriers for which a checkpoint will be created. The value must be a positive integer. Since v2.5.0, this setting can also be configured per-database to better accommodate diverse workloads. See [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/commands/sql-create-database) for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| parallel\_compact\_size\_mb                | This parameter, together with `max_sub_compaction`, controls the concurrency of individual tasks. <ul><li>If the data size is smaller than `parallel_compact_size_mb`, only a single thread is used to execute the compaction task.</li><li>If the data size of an individual task exceeds `parallel_compact_size_mb`, multiple concurrent threads are started to complete the task. At this time, if the data size is N, then the total number of these threads is determined by dividing N by `parallel_compact_size_mb`.</li></ul> Additionally, each sub-task's size cannot exceed `parallel_compact_size_mb`, and the total number of sub-tasks cannot exceed `max_sub_compaction`. |

| pause\_on\_next\_bootstrap                 | This parameter is used for debugging and maintenance purposes. Setting it to true will pause all data sources, such as connectors and DMLs, when the cluster restarts. This parameter will then be reset to its default value (false). To resume data ingestion, simply run `risectl meta resume` or restart the cluster again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| enable\_tracing                            | Whether to enable distributed tracing. This parameter is used to toggle the opentelemetry tracing during runtime. Its default value is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| time\_travel\_retention\_ms                | The data retention period for time travel. Defaults to 0, which disables time travel. To enable this feature, set it to a a non-zero value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| per_database_isolation                | Enables per-database failure isolation, so that failures such as streaming job errors or worker crashes in one database do not affect other databases. Defaults to `true`. For more details of database isolation, see [Workload isolation and interaction](/operate/workload-isolation-interaction).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## How to view system parameters?

You can use the `SHOW PARAMETERS` command to view the system parameters, along with their current values.

The `Mutable` column indicates whether the parameter can be altered using the [ALTER SYSTEM SET](#how-to-adjust-system-parameters) command after the system is running. `t` means it can be altered using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` command while `f` means it cannot be altered using the command.

```bash
SHOW PARAMETERS;
```

```

## How to configure system parameters?

Mutable and immutable parameters are configured differently.

You can configure mutable parameters using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` command in `psql`.

The full syntax of the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` statement is:

```bash
ALTER SYSTEM SET parameter_name { TO | = } { value | 'value' | DEFAULT };
```

Immutable parameters need to be initialized in the CLI of the Meta Node. `state_store` and `data_directory` need to be initialized before starting a cluster.

To configure parameter settings in the CLI of the Meta Node, navigate to the directory where RisingWave is installed and run the following command:

```bash
meta-node --<parameter_name> <value>
```

For example, to initialize the setting of `data_directory`:

`meta-node --data_directory "hummock_001"`

<Note>
As RisingWave reads system parameters at different times, there is no guarantee that a parameter value change will take effect immediately. We recommend that you adjust system parameters before running a streaming query after your RisingWave cluster starts.
