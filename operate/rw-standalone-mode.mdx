RisingWave standalone mode is a simplified deployment mode for RisingWave. It is designed to be minimal, easy to install, and configure.

Unlike other deployment modes, for instance [Docker Compose](/deploy/risingwave-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes), RisingWave standalone mode starts the cluster as a single process. This means that components including `serving node`, `streaming node`, `meta node`, and `compactor node` are all embedded in this process.

RisingWave by default uses object storage to persist data. In the standalone mode, we use the embedded `LocalFs` Object Store, eliminating the need for an external service like `minio` or `s3`; for meta store, we will use the embedded `SQLite` database, eliminating the need for an external service like `etcd`.

By default, the RisingWave standalone mode will store its data in `~/.risingwave`, which includes both `Metadata` and `State Data`.

For a batteries-included setup, with `monitoring` tools and external services like `kafka` fully included, you can use [Docker Compose](/deploy/risingwave-docker-compose) instead. If you would like to set up these external services manually, you may check out RisingWave's [Docker Compose](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml), and run these services using the same configurations.

### Configure RisingWave standalone mode

The instance of RisingWave standalone mode can run without any configuration. However, there are some options available to customize the instance.

The main options which new users may require would be the state store directory (`--state-store-directory`) and in-memory mode (`--in-memory`).

`--state-store-directory` specifies the new directory where the cluster's `Metadata` and `State Data` will reside. The default is to store it in the `~/.risingwave` folder.

```bash
# Reconfigure RisingWave to be stored under 'projects' folder instead.
risingwave --state-store-directory ~/projects/risingwave
```

`--in-memory` will run an in-memory instance of RisingWave, both `Metadata` and `State Data` will not be persisted.

```bash
risingwave --in-memory
```

You can view other options with:

```bash
risingwave single --help
```

### Monitor RisingWave standalone mode with Grafana and Prometheus

To monitor your standalone cluster, you may wish to integrate metrics monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus.

First install [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/).

Next, clone the [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) repository, it contains various configuration files.

Start the RisingWave standalone cluster.

Make sure you're in the `RisingWave` directory.

Start your prometheus instance:

```bash
prometheus --config.file=./standalone/prometheus.yml --web.listen-address=0.0.0.0:9500
```

Then start the Grafana instance:

```bash
grafana server --config ./standalone/grafana.ini
```

Next, add the Prometheus Data Source on the Grafana Dashboard: [http://localhost:3001/connections/datasources/prometheus](http://localhost:3001/connections/datasources/prometheus).

```bash
name: risedev-prometheus
Prometheus Server URL: http://localhost:9500
```

Finally, add the User and Dev Dashboard: [http://localhost:3001/dashboard/import](http://localhost:3001/dashboard/import). The file paths are `grafana/risingwave-dev-dashboard.json`, `grafana/risingwave-user-dashboard.json`.

With that you can now monitor your standalone cluster with Grafana and Prometheus.
