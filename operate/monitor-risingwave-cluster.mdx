description: "If you run RisingWave in a Kubernetes cluster, you can monitor its performance, including the usage of resources like CPU, memory, and network, and the status of different nodes."

## Install the monitoring stack

To monitor a RisingWave cluster, you can use the monitoring stack in the `RisingWave-Operator` repository. The stack includes Prometheus for collecting data, Grafana for visualization and alerting, and other necessary resources.

Clone or download the `RisingWave-Operator` repository to your environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-operator.git
```

Run the script to install the monitoring stack. It will create the `monitoring` namespace and deploy all monitoring services in the namespace.

```bash
./monitoring/install.sh
```

## Start monitoring

The RisingWave operator is now integrated with the Prometheus operator, which creates a service monitor for RisingWave and ensures that data is collected automatically.

1. Check if Prometheus is collecting data from RisingWave:
```bash
kubectl get servicemonitors -A -l risingwave/name
```
The expected output is like this:
```bash
NAMESPACE    NAME                         AGE
monitoring   risingwave-service-monitor   119m
```
2. Forward the web port of Grafana to localhost.
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:http-web
```
The command above allows you to access Grafana from the local machine only. If you need to access Grafana from a different host, append `--address 0.0.0.0` to the command to allow Grafana to accept requests from external hosts. The complete command is:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:http-web --address 0.0.0.0
```
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if you access Grafana from a local machine, or `http://<client_address>:3000` if you access Grafana from a different host, where `<client_address>` is the IP address of the machine running the Grafana service. When prompted, enter the default credentials (username: `admin`; password: `prom-operator`).
4. From **Dashboards**, select **RisingWave** \-> **RisingWave Dashboard**. You can edit metrics in the dashboard and add new metrics.

## Generate a Grafana dashboard for multiple RisingWave clusters

This section explains how to generate a Grafana dashboard for monitoring multiple RisingWave clusters deployed within a Kubernetes environment. These steps only generate the dashboard's JSON model and can be performed on any machine with the necessary tools.


1. Clone the [risingwave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave.git
```

2. Follow the instructions in the [RisingWave Grafana directory README](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/blob/main/grafana/README.md) to configure the required toolchain.

3. Generate the Grafana dashboard JSON model.
Execute the following command to create the Grafana dashboard JSON model, enabling multi-cluster support:
```bash
DASHBOARD_NAMESPACE_FILTER_ENABLED=true \
DASHBOARD_RISINGWAVE_NAME_FILTER_ENABLED=true \
DASHBOARD_DYNAMIC_SOURCE=true \
DASHBOARD_UID=risingwave_dashboard \
./generate.sh
```
This command sets several environment variables to configure the dashboard generation:

- `DASHBOARD_NAMESPACE_FILTER_ENABLED=true`: Enables filtering by Kubernetes namespace.

- `DASHBOARD_RISINGWAVE_NAME_FILTER_ENABLED=true`: Enables filtering by RisingWave cluster name.

- `DASHBOARD_DYNAMIC_SOURCE=true`: Enables dynamic selection of the data source in Grafana.

- `DASHBOARD_UID=risingwave_dashboard`: Sets the unique identifier (UID) for the dashboard.
4. Import the generated JSON models (with the extension `.gen.json`) into your Grafana instance.


### Troubleshooting

#### Namespace filter not working

If the namespace filter in your Grafana dashboard is not functioning correctly, the issue may stem from the absence of the `risingwave_name` label in your collected metrics. To resolve this, you can use the metricRelabelings and relabelings fields in the [Prometheus Operator endpoint spec](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api-reference/api.md#endpoint) to append this label to your metrics.
