title: "View and configure runtime parameters"

## What are runtime parameters?

Runtime parameters are variables that can be set at runtime to configure the behavior of RisingWave. They are also known as session variables.

## How to view runtime parameters?

You can use the `SHOW ALL` command to view the runtime parameters, their current settings, and some notes about these parameters.

```bash
SHOW ALL;
```

For example, you may see a table similar to this:

```bsh Runtime Parameters
          Name                  |     Setting     |        Description
--------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------
 implicit_flush                 | false           | If set to `true`, every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement will block until the entire dataflow is refreshed.
 create_compaction_group_for_mv | false           | If set to `true`, RisingWave will create dedicated compaction groups when creating these materialized views.
 query_mode                     | auto            | A temporary config variable to force query running in either local or distributed mode. If the value is auto, the system will decide for you automatically.
 ...
```

Below is the detailed information about the parameters you may see after using the `SHOW ALL` command:

| Name                                         | Values or examples        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you just want to view a specific parameter's value, you can also use the `SHOW` command.

```sql
SHOW parameter_name;
```

## How to configure runtime parameters?

You can use `SET` command or the `set_config()` function to change the setting of a runtime parameter.

The syntax of the `SET` command is:

```sql
SET parameter_name { TO | = } { value | 'value' | DEFAULT};
```

Where `parameter_name` is the name of the parameter, and `value` or `'value'` is the new value of the parameter. `DEFAULT` can be written to specify resetting the parameter to its default value.

For details about the `set_config()` function, see [System administration functions](/sql/functions/sys-admin#set-config), and for details about the `SET` command, see [SET](/sql/commands/sql-set).

<Note>
`SET` applies only to the current session.
</Note>

You can also use the [ALTER SYSTEM SET](/sql/commands/sql-alter-system) command to set a system-wide default value for a runtime parameter. This configuration will then be applied to every new session.

<Note>
`ALTER SYSTEM SET` takes effect in new sessions. The value of the runtime parameter remains unchanged in the current session.
</Note>

```sql Syntax
ALTER SYSTEM SET session_param_name TO session_param_value;
```
