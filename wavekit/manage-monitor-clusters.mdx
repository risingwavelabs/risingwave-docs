description: "Learn how to view your connected RisingWave clusters in Wavekit, access detailed information, and use its operational tools."

After [connecting your RisingWave clusters](/wavekit/connect-risingwave-clusters) to Wavekit, you can use the UI to view their status and access several operational tools provided on the "Cluster Details" page.

## The clusters page

The "Clusters" page lists all RisingWave cluster connections configured in Wavekit. For each cluster, you'll typically see its Name, Status (as reported by Wavekit), Number of Nodes, and Host. Actions to `Edit` or `Delete` the connection from Wavekit are also available here.

Clicking on a cluster in this list navigates you to its dedicated "Cluster Details" page.

## The cluster details page

This page provides an in-depth view and operational tools for the selected RisingWave cluster.

### Cluster information panel

This section displays a summary of the cluster's connection information and its reported status, including: `Name`, `Status`, `Number of Nodes`, `Host`, and configured ports (SQL, Meta Node, HTTP).

### Executing `risectl` commands

Wavekit provides an interface to run `risectl` (RisingWave's command-line control utility) commands directly on the selected cluster.

*   How to use: In the "Risectl Command" section, enter the arguments for your `risectl` command (e.g., `meta-node list`) into the text area and click `Run Command`. The base `risectl` command is implied.
*   Output: The command's output is displayed within the UI.
*   Purpose: Useful for various administrative and diagnostic tasks supported by `risectl`.
*   Note on `WK_RISECTLDIR`: The `WK_RISECTLDIR` environment variable may be relevant if Wavekit needs to locate `risectl` resources or binaries on its host system.

### Managing metadata snapshots

Wavekit facilitates the management of RisingWave cluster metadata snapshots, which are important for backup and recovery.

*   Manual snapshots: The `Create Snapshot` button in the "Metadata Snapshot" section triggers snapshot creation on the RisingWave cluster.
*   Automated backups:
    *   You can enable `Auto Backup` and configure the `Backup Interval` (e.g., "Every 30 minutes") and how long snapshots are `Keep For` (e.g., "7 days").
*   Viewing snapshots: The UI indicates if snapshots are available.
    
<Note>
Wavekit helps create these snapshots. The restoration process typically follows standard RisingWave procedures.

### Collecting diagnostic information

For advanced troubleshooting, Wavekit can assist in collecting diagnostic data from your RisingWave cluster.

*   Manual collection: Use the `Collect Diagnostic` button in the "Diagnostic Information" section.
*   Automated collection:
    *   Enable `Auto Diagnostic` and configure the `Collection Interval` and `Data Retention` period.
*   Accessing data: The UI will show if diagnostic data is available. Refer to Wavekit or RisingWave documentation for details on how this data is structured or utilized.

These features on the "Cluster Details" page offer convenient access to important operational tasks for your RisingWave clusters.
