Wavekit is an on-premise user interface designed by RisingWave Labs to enhance your observability and simplify the management of your existing RisingWave clusters. It provides a centralized web-based dashboard to connect to, monitor, and interact with your RisingWave deployments, whether they are running in Docker, on Kubernetes, or even in RisingWave Cloud.

## Key features and benefits

Wavekit empowers you to:

*   Centralize cluster connections: Manage connection details for all your RisingWave clusters in one place.
*   Monitor cluster status: Get at-a-glance information about your connected clusters, including their status and node count.
*   Execute `risectl` commands: Run RisingWave's command-line utility (`risectl`) commands directly on your clusters through the Wavekit UI.
*   Manage metadata snapshots: Easily create manual metadata snapshots of your RisingWave clusters and configure automated backups for disaster recovery and state management.
*   Collect diagnostic information: Trigger and automate the collection of diagnostic data and system metrics for advanced troubleshooting.
*   Utilize an interactive SQL console:
    *   Connect to specific databases within your RisingWave clusters.
    *   Explore database schemas (tables, views, materialized views, sources, sinks).
    *   Write and execute SQL queries with support for multiple tabs and query history.
    *   Visualize streaming data flows with an integrated `Streaming Graph` for queries involving streaming entities.
*   Maintain control: As an on-premise tool, Wavekit and its metadata (stored in a PostgreSQL database you manage) remain within your infrastructure.

The primary benefits include simplified operations, improved observability into your streaming data platform, and efficient troubleshooting, all from a convenient web interface.
