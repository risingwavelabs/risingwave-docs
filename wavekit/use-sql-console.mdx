Wavekit includes a powerful, web-based SQL Console that allows you to directly interact with the databases within your connected RisingWave clusters. You can execute queries, explore your database objects, view query history, and even visualize streaming data flows.

## Configuring database connections for the SQL console

Before you can run queries, you need to tell the SQL Console how to connect to specific databases within your RisingWave instances. This involves defining a "database connection" which uses one of your already configured "cluster connections" (from Wavekit's "Clusters" section) and adds specific database credentials.

1.  Access the SQL Console: From the main Wavekit dashboard, click on the "SQL Console" card or the corresponding icon (`< >`) in the sidebar.
2.  Open database management: Inside the SQL Console, click the 'Manage Databases' button (usually located at the top left).
3.  Add a new database connection:
    *   The "Database Management" modal will appear. If this is your first time, it will likely be empty.
    *   Click the '+ Add Database' button.
    *   Fill in the "Add New Database" form:
        *   'Name': A user-friendly name for this specific database connection (e.g., `Primary App DB`, `Analytics User on Prod RW`). This name will help you identify it in the SQL Console.
        *   'Cluster': From the dropdown, select the RisingWave Cluster (that you previously added in Wavekit's "Clusters" section) to which this database belongs. This tells Wavekit the host and SQL port to use.
        *   'Username': Enter the database username for connecting to RisingWave (e.g., `root`, `app_user`).
        *   'Password': Provide the password for the specified username.
        *   'Database Name': Specify the name of the database within the RisingWave cluster you want to connect to (e.g., `dev`, `postgres`, `rw_db`).
    *   Click 'Test Connection' to verify that Wavekit can connect to the RisingWave database using these credentials.
    *   If the test is successful, click 'Add Database'.
4.  The configured database connection will now be listed in the "Database Management" modal and will be available for use in the SQL Console. You can add multiple database connections for different databases or users.
5.  Click 'Close' on the "Database Management" modal.

## SQL console interface overview

The SQL Console is typically laid out with several key areas:

*   Database/Schema explorer (Left Pane): Once a database connection is active (e.g., `rw (Default Local Cluster)`), this pane allows you to browse your connected RisingWave cluster's databases, schemas, and objects like tables, views, materialized views (MVs), sources, and sinks. Expanding these items can show columns and their types.
*   Query editor (Center Pane): This is where you write your SQL queries.
    *   Tabs: You can open multiple query tabs (e.g., "Query 1", "setup", "+") to work on different queries simultaneously.
    *   The 'Run' Button: Executes the SQL query in the active tab.
    *   The 'Background DDL' Checkbox: (If visible) This option may influence how Data Definition Language (DDL) statements (like `CREATE TABLE`) are executed, potentially allowing them to run as background tasks in RisingWave for long-running operations without blocking the console. (Consult RisingWave documentation for specifics on background DDL.)
*   Results pane (Bottom Pane): After executing a query, this area displays the output, organized into tabs:
    *   Result: Shows the data returned by `SELECT` queries in a tabular format, or success/error messages for DDL/DML statements.
    *   History: Displays a log of queries executed in the current session or tab.
    *   Streaming Graph: (A key feature for RisingWave!) For queries that define or relate to streaming entities (like Materialized Views, Sources, Sinks), this tab provides a visual representation of the data flow graph, showing dependencies and how data moves between these components. The legend helps identify different entity types.
    *   Progress: For long-running queries, this tab might show execution progress or status updates.

## Writing and executing queries

1.  Select your target: Ensure the correct database connection is active or selected for your query tab (the UI will usually show this in the schema explorer or a dropdown near the 'Manage Databases' button).
2.  Write your SQL: Type your SQL statement into the query editor pane.
3.  Run the query: Click the 'Run' button or use any available keyboard shortcut.
4.  View the output: Examine the "Result," "History," "Streaming Graph," or "Progress" tabs in the results pane as needed.

The SQL Console in Wavekit provides a convenient and integrated way to interact with your RisingWave data directly from your browser, enhancing your development and operational workflows.
