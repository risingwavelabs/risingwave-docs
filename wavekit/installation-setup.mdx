This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up WaveKit. WaveKit requires a PostgreSQL database to store its metadata (like cluster connection details). You can use a bundled PostgreSQL for quick setup or connect to your own existing instance.

## Key configuration variables

Before you begin, be aware of these key environment variables that WaveKit uses:

*   `WK_PORT`: (Optional) Specifies the port on which the WaveKit server will listen. Defaults to `8020`.
*   `WK_PG_DSN`: (Required for binary and Docker Compose with external PG) The PostgreSQL connection string for WaveKit's metadata database.
    *   Format: `postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>`
    *   It's important to note that this database is used by WaveKit to store its own operational data and does *not* store your RisingWave cluster's user data.
*   `WK_ROOT_PASSWORD`: (Optional) Sets the initial password for the `root` user in the WaveKit UI. If not set, it defaults to `root`. It's recommended to set this for any persistent deployment.
*   `WK_RISECTLDIR`: (Optional) May be used by WaveKit if it needs to locate `risectl` resources for executing commands against your RisingWave cluster. The default behavior usually suffices.

## Option 1: Quick setup with docker (bundled PostgreSQL)

This is the fastest way to try WaveKit. The `risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle` image includes a PostgreSQL server. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the desired WaveKit version (for example, `v0.4.0`).

A. Ephemeral storage (for testing only)
All WaveKit metadata will be lost if the container is removed.

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 --name wavekit risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```
   To set a custom root password:
   ```shell
   docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 -e WK_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password --name wavekit risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```

B. Persistent storage (recommended for standalone Docker)
WaveKit metadata is stored in a Docker volume (`wavekit-data`), ensuring data persists across container restarts or recreations.

   ```shell
   docker run -d -p 8020:8020 --name wavekit \
     -e WK_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
     -v wavekit-data:/var/lib/postgresql \
     risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```

## Option 2: Setup with binary (requires external PostgreSQL)

This method uses a standalone WaveKit binary and requires you to have a separate, running PostgreSQL database.

1.  Download and install the latest WaveKit binary:
    ```shell
    curl https://wavekit-release.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/download.sh | sh
    ```
2.  Ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible and set the `WK_PG_DSN` environment variable. Then, run WaveKit:
    ```shell
    WK_PG_DSN="postgres://your_user:your_pass@your_pg_host:5432/wavekit_db" \
    WK_ROOT_PASSWORD="your_secure_password" \
    ./wavekit
    ```
    (Adjust `WK_PG_DSN` and `WK_ROOT_PASSWORD` accordingly.)

## Option 3: Recommended setup (docker compose with external PostgreSQL)

This method uses Docker Compose to run WaveKit and allows you to easily manage it alongside your own PostgreSQL instance (either also as a Docker container or an external one).

1.  Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      wavekit:
        image: risingwavelabs/wavekit:vX.Y.Z # Use the image without -pgbundle
        ports:
          - "8020:8020" # Or your WK_PORT
        environment:
          WK_PORT: 8020 # Optional, if different from default
          WK_PG_DSN: postgres://postgres_user:postgres_password@db_host:5432/wavekit_metadata_db # IMPORTANT: Point to your PG
          WK_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_secure_password
          # WK_RISECTLDIR: /path/if/needed
        depends_on:
          - db # Only if PostgreSQL is also managed by this Docker Compose file

      # Example: If running PostgreSQL in Docker Compose as well
      db:
        image: "postgres:15" # Or your preferred version
        ports:
          - "5432:5432" # Expose if needed externally, otherwise WaveKit connects via Docker network
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres_user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres_password
          POSTGRES_DB: wavekit_metadata_db
        volumes:
          - postgres_wavekit_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    volumes:
      postgres_wavekit_data: # For the PostgreSQL container
    ```
    Note:
    *   Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the specific WaveKit version (for example, `v0.4.0`).
    *   Adjust `WK_PG_DSN` to point to your PostgreSQL instance. If `db` is a service in the same Docker Compose, you can use `db_host: db`.
    *   Update PostgreSQL credentials and database name.

2.  Start WaveKit:
    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Verifying the installation

After starting WaveKit, check its logs to ensure it started without errors:
*   If using Docker/Docker Compose: `docker logs wavekit` (or your service name).
*   If using binary: Observe the terminal output.

## Initial login and dashboard overview

1.  Access WaveKit UI: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8020` (or the host/port you configured).
2.  Login:
    *   Username: `root`
    *   Password: The password you set via `WK_ROOT_PASSWORD`, or `root` if not set.
3.  Dashboard: Upon successful login, you'll see the WaveKit dashboard. This is your main entry point to:
    *   Manage 'Clusters': For connecting to your RisingWave instances.
    *   Use the 'SQL Console': For querying your RisingWave data.
    *   Access links to external resources and documentation.
