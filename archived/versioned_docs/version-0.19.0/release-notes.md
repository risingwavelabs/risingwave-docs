  - Old: `CREATE SOURCE s1 WITH ( 'connector' = 'kafka', 'kafka.topic' = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', 'kafka.brokers' = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`  
  - New: `CREATE SOURCE s WITH ( connector = 'kafka', kafka.topic = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', kafka.brokers = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`
