description: "Learn how to submit effective /docs requests on Slack for faster documentation updates and improvements."

When you identify missing, incorrect, or unclear documentation, you can request updates using the `/docs` Slack command in the RisingWave Community Slack. To ensure your request receives a timely response and leads to actionable documentation improvements, please provide structured details that help maintainers understand exactly what needs to be documented.

## Documentation request template

Use this template when submitting a `/docs` request to ensure you provide all necessary information:

```
/docs

**Product/Feature Area:** [e.g., SQL commands, Kafka connector, materialized views, deployment]

**Current Docs URL:** [Link to existing page if any, or "N/A" for new content]

**What is missing/incorrect:** 
[Brief description of the gap, error, or unclear content]

**Expected outcome:** 
[What information should the docs contain or how should it be corrected]

**User persona:** 
[Who needs this? e.g., new users, data engineers, DBAs, developers migrating from Flink]

**Repro steps or SQL examples (if relevant):**
[Commands, queries, or steps that demonstrate the issue or feature]
```

## Examples

### ✅ Good request example

```
/docs

**Product/Feature Area:** SQL commands - CREATE SOURCE with Kafka

**Current Docs URL:** https://docs.risingwave.com/ingestion/sources/kafka

**What is missing/incorrect:** 
The documentation doesn't explain how to configure SASL/SCRAM authentication 
with Kafka sources when using AWS MSK.

**Expected outcome:** 
Add a section showing the complete CREATE SOURCE syntax with SASL_SCRAM properties, 
including required connection parameters for AWS MSK.

**User persona:** 
Data engineers deploying RisingWave with AWS MSK in production environments.

**Repro steps or SQL examples:**
```sql
CREATE SOURCE kafka_source (
  id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR
) WITH (
  connector='kafka',
  topic='my-topic',
  properties.bootstrap.server='my-cluster.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9096',
  -- Need documentation for these SASL/SCRAM properties:
  properties.security.protocol='SASL_SSL',
  properties.sasl.mechanism='SCRAM-SHA-512',
  properties.sasl.username='my-username',
  properties.sasl.password='my-password'
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```
```

**Why this is effective:** This request provides specific details about the feature area, identifies the exact gap, shows who needs it, and includes a concrete SQL example that demonstrates the use case.

### ❌ Bad request example

```
/docs

The Kafka documentation is confusing and needs to be updated.
```

**Why this is ineffective:** This request lacks specificity. Maintainers cannot determine:
- Which Kafka documentation page needs updates
- What specific content is confusing
- What should be added or changed
- Who the target audience is
- What use case needs to be documented

## Tips for effective documentation requests

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Be specific about location">
Link to the exact page that needs updates, or specify the section if requesting new content. This helps maintainers quickly locate and update the right documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include working examples">
If your request involves SQL, configuration, or code, provide complete, runnable examples. This ensures the documentation will include accurate, tested content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Explain the user impact">
Describe who is affected by the missing or incorrect documentation. This helps maintainers prioritize requests and tailor the content to the right audience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Separate multiple issues">
If you have multiple unrelated documentation issues, submit separate `/docs` requests for each. This makes it easier to track and address each issue independently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check existing documentation first">
Before submitting a request, search the documentation to confirm the information is truly missing or incorrect. You might find it in a different section than expected.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What happens after submission

After you submit a `/docs` request with sufficient detail:

1. The documentation team reviews your request
2. Maintainers may ask clarifying questions if needed
3. A documentation update is created and reviewed
4. The updated documentation is published
5. You'll be notified when the documentation is updated

For urgent documentation needs or complex requests that require discussion, consider opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-docs/issues) in the risingwave-docs repository with the same detailed information.
