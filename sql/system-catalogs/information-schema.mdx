## Tables

The `information_schema.tables` view contains all tables, views, sinks, and materialized views defined in the current database.

<Note>
Materialized views are specific to the information schema of RisingWave. They are not included in the information schema of PostgreSQL.
</Note>

The `information_schema.tables` view contains the following columns.

| Column               | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| table\_catalog       | varchar | Name of the current database.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| table\_schema        | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the table, view, or materialized view. The default schema for user-created objects is public.                                                                        |
| table\_name          | varchar | Name of the table, view, or materialized view.                                                                                                                                                         |
| table\_type          | varchar | Type of the table, view, or materialized view. BASE TABLE for a user-defined table, VIEW for a non-materialized view, MATERIALIZED VIEW for a materialized view, and SYSTEM TABLE for a system table. |
| is\_insertable\_into | varchar | YES if the table or view is insertable into, NO if not. User-defined tables are always insertable, while views and materialized views are not necessarily.

## Table constraints

The `table_constraints` view contains all constraints for tables that the current user owns or has privileges other than `SELECT` on.

The `table_constraints` view contains the following columns.

|Column|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| `constraint_catalog` | varchar | Name of the database that contains the constraint. |
| `constraint_schema` | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the constraint. |
| `constraint_name` | varchar | Name of the constraint. |
| `table_catalog` | varchar | Name of the database that contains the table. |
| `table_schema` | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the table. |
| `table_name` | varchar | Name of the table. |
| `constraint_type` | varchar | Type of the constraint: `PRIMARY KEY`(p), `UNIQUE`(u), `CHECK`(c), or `EXCLUDE`(x).  |
| `is_deferrable` | varchar | `YES` if the constraint is deferrable, `NO` if not. |
| `initially_deferred` | varchar | `YES` if the constraint is deferrable and initially deferred, `NO` if not. |
| `enforced` | varchar | `YES` if the constraint is validated and enforced, `NO` if not. |

<Note>
**TEMPORARY LIMITATION**

This view assumes the constraint schema is the same as the table schema, since `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` only supports primary key.

</Note>

## Schemata

The `schemata` view contains all accessible schemas in the current database for users, either by way of being the owner or having some privilege.

It contains the following columns.

|Column|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`catalog_name`| varchar | Name of the database containing the schema.  |
|`schema_name`| varchar | Name of the schema. |
|`schema_owner` | varchar | Name of the schema owner.|
|`default_character_set_catalog` | varchar | Name of the database that contains the schema's default character set.|
|`default_character_set_schema`|varchar | Name of the schema containing the default character set. |
|`default_character_set_name`|varchar |Name of the schema's default character set.|
|`sql_path`|varchar | SQL path specification for the schema.|

## Views

The `information_schema.views` view contains information about the views in the database.

It contains the following columns.

| Column           | Type    | Description                               |
| :--------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| `table_catalog`   | varchar | Name of the current database.              |
| `table_schema`    | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the view. |
| `table_name`      | varchar | Name of the view.                          |
| `view_definition` | varchar | SQL statement that defines the view.       |

<Note>
**TEMPORARY LIMITATION**

Users with access to `information_schema.views` can potentially access all views, which poses a security risk. We are working to resolve this limitation. Once the fix is implemented, this message will be removed.
</Note>

## Columns

The `information_schema.columns` view contains information about columns of all tables, views, and materialized views in the database.

| Column                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                          |

| `table_schema`          | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the table, sink, view, or materialized view. The default schema for user-created objects is public. |
| `table_name`            | varchar | Name of the table, sink, view, or materialized view.                                                                                  |

| `data_type`             | varchar | Data type of the column.                                                                                                              |
| `is_generated`          | varchar | ALWAYS if the column has a generated value; NEVER if it doesn't.                                                                     |

| `_rw_timestamp` | timestamptz | Internal timestamp indicating when each row was last updated. Only available in the batch query.|

## How to use the information schema views?

You can use various information schema views to determine the makeup of tables, sinks, views, and materialized views in a database.

For example, you can query for names and types of all the tables, views, and materialized views in the current database:

```sql
SELECT table_name, table_type
FROM information_schema.tables;
```

To query for all of the columns in a table, sink, view, or materialized view called `taxi_trip`:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name='taxi_trip';
```

To find out tables, sinks, views, and materialized views that contain a column called `trip_id`:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name='trip_id';
```
