title: "RisingWave catalogs"
description: "RisingWave catalogs contain system tables and views that provide metadata about different relations in the system, as well as information about the cluster jobs and their status."
---

The metadata includes details about each database, schema, and relation in the system, such as materialized views, tables, sources, sinks, indexes, and views. The status information includes the progress of DDL commands, system snapshots, and more.

## How to display RisingWave catalogs

After you connect to RisingWave via `psql`, enter `\d` to display RisingWave catalogs.

The result looks like this:

```sql
\d
------RESULTS
                        List of relations
   Schema   |                Name                 | Type  | Owner
------------+-------------------------------------+-------+-------
 rw_catalog | rw_actors                           | table | root
 rw_catalog | rw_columns                          | table | root
 rw_catalog | rw_connections                      | table | root
...
```

You can view the schemas of these catalogs:

```sql
DESCRIBE rw_catalog.rw_ddl_progress;
------RESULTS
     Name      |  Type
---------------+---------
 ddl_id        | bigint
 ddl_statement | varchar
 progress      | varchar
(3 rows)
```

```sql
DESCRIBE rw_catalog.rw_meta_snapshot;
------RESULTS
          Name          |            Type
------------------------+-----------------------------
 meta_snapshot_id       | bigint
 hummock_version_id     | bigint
 safe_epoch             | bigint
 safe_epoch_ts          | timestamp without time zone
 max_committed_epoch    | bigint
 max_committed_epoch_ts | timestamp without time zone
(6 rows)
```

You can also retrieve the values of the catalogs. Please note that the schema (`rw_catalog`) is optional.

```sql
SELECT name, owner, definition FROM rw_tables;
------RESULTS
 name | owner |            definition
------+-------+----------------------------------
 t1   |     1 | CREATE TABLE t1 (v1 INT, v2 INT)
(1 row)
```

You can use two time-related fields, `created_at` and `initiated_at`, to retrieve the times when an object is created and initialized. This can be useful when you want learn about when a source or materialized view is created or initialized.

```sql
SELECT name, initialized_at, created_at FROM rw_sources;
------RESULT
 name |        initialized_at         |          created_at
------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
 s    | 2023-07-25 10:53:30.128+00:00 | 2023-07-25 10:53:30.130+00:00
(1 row)
```
