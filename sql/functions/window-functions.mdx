description: 'Window functions compute a single result for each row over a set of rows that are related to the current row (the "window").'
---

For details about the syntax of window function calls, see [Window function calls](/sql/query-syntax/value-exp#window-function-calls).

## General-purpose window functions

### `row_number()`

The `row_number()` function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition of a result set. The numbering starts at 1 for the first row in each partition and increments by 1 for each subsequent row.

`row_number()` can be used to turn non-unique rows into unique rows. This could be used to eliminate duplicate rows.

```sql Syntax
row_number() → integer
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    row_number() OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as r,
    col1, col2
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 r | col1 | col2
---+------+------
 1 |    a |  100
 2 |    a |  105
 1 |    b |  103
 2 |    b |  107
 3 |    b |  107
 4 |    b |  109
```

<Note>
We recommend using `row_number()` only for top-N pattern queries. For details about this pattern, see [Top-N by group](/processing/sql/top-n-by-group).
</Note>

### `rank()`

`rank()` returns the rank of the current row, with gaps; that is, the `row_number` of the first row in its peer group.

```sql Syntax
rank() → integer
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    rank() OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as r,
    col1, col2
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 r | col1 | col2
---+------+------
 1 |    a |  100
 2 |    a |  105
 1 |    b |  103
 2 |    b |  107
 2 |    b |  107
 4 |    b |  109
```

### `dense_rank()`

`dense_rank()` returns the rank of the current row, without gaps; that is, if some rows share the same rank, the row next to them is assigned the next consecutive rank.

```sql Syntax
dense_rank() → integer
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    dense_rank() OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as r,
    col1, col2
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 r | col1 | col2
---+------+------
 1 |    a |  100
 2 |    a |  105
 1 |    b |  103
 2 |    b |  107
 2 |    b |  107
 3 |    b |  109
```

### `lag()` and `lead()`

`lag()` allows you to access the value of a previous row in the result set. You can specify the number of rows to look back.

```sql Syntax
lag ( value anycompatible [, offset const integer] ) → anycompatible
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    col1, col2,
    lag(col2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as lag
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 col1 | col2 |  lag
------+------|------
    a |  100 | NULL
    a |  105 |  100
    b |  103 | NULL
    b |  107 |  103
    b |  107 |  107
    b |  109 |  107
```

`lead()` is similar to `lag()`, but it allows you to access the value of a subsequent row in the result set.

```sql Syntax
lead ( value anycompatible [, offset const integer] ) → anycompatible
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    col1, col2,
    lead(col2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as lead
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 col1 | col2 | lead
------+------|------
    a |  100 |  105
    a |  105 | NULL
    b |  103 |  107
    b |  107 |  107
    b |  107 |  109
    b |  109 | NULL
```

### `first_value()` and `last_value()`

<Note>
Added in v2.3.0: Support `IGNORE NULLS`.
</Note>

The `first_value()` function returns the value of the first row in the current window frame. If `IGNORE NULLS` is present, `first_value()` returns the first non-null value.

```sql Syntax
first_value ( value anyelement [ IGNORE NULLS ] ) → anyelement
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    col1, col2,
    first_value(col2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
    ) as first
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 col1 | col2 | first
------+------|-------
    a |  100 |   100
    a |  105 |   100
    b |  103 |   103
    b |  107 |   103
    b |  107 |   103
    b |  109 |   103
```

`last_value()` returns the value of the last row in the current window frame. If `IGNORE NULLS` is present, `last_value()` returns the last non-null value.

```sql Syntax
last_value ( value anyelement [ IGNORE NULLS ] ) → anyelement
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    col1, col2,
    last_value(col2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
        -- ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as last
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 col1 | col2 | last
------+------|------
    a |  100 |  100
    a |  105 |  105
    b |  103 |  103
    b |  107 |  107
    b |  107 |  107
    b |  109 |  109
```

```sql Example
SELECT
    col1, col2,
    last_value(col2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col1
        ORDER BY col2
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as last
FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
----
 col1 | col2 | last
------+------|------
    a |  100 |  105
    a |  105 |  105
    b |  103 |  109
    b |  107 |  109
    b |  107 |  109
    b |  109 |  109
```

### Named window

<Note>
Added in v2.5.0.
</Note>

When multiple window functions share the same partitioning and ordering logic, repeating the same `OVER` clause can be error-prone. To avoid redundancy, you can define a **named window** in the `WINDOW` clause of a query and reference it by name in [window function calls](/sql/query-syntax/value-exp#window-function-calls).

```sql Syntax
WINDOW window_name AS ...
```

```sql Example
-- Without named window
SELECT
  sum(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC),
  avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM empsalary;

-- With named window
SELECT sum(salary) OVER w, avg(salary) OVER w
  FROM empsalary
  WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC);
```

The `WINDOW` keyword is now a reserved keyword and cannot be directly used as table alias.

## Aggregate window functions

All aggregate functions, including builtin ones such as `sum()` and `min()`, user-defined ones and `AGGREGATE:`-prefixed scalar functions, can be used as window functions.

For the complete list of builtin aggregate functions and their usage, see [Aggregate functions](/sql/functions/aggregate).
