Timestamp data types are used to store and process precise time information. RisingWave supports two types of timestamps:

- `timestamp`: Stores date and time values without timezone, supporting up to **nanosecond** precision (9 digits after the decimal point).

- `timestamptz`: Stores date and time values along with time zone information, supporting up to **microsecond** precision (6 digits after the decimal point).


## Precision preservation

Nanosecond precision is fully maintained for `timestamp` during the following operations:

- Reading from or writing to external sources (Kafka, Iceberg, Parquet, etc.) preserves nanoseconds automatically.

- Adding or subtracting an interval from a timestamp.

    ```sql Add an interval
    SELECT '2022-03-13 01:00:00.123456789'::timestamp + INTERVAL '24' HOUR;
    -- Result: 2022-03-14 01:00:00.123456789
    ```

    ```sql Subtract an interval
    SELECT '2022-03-14 01:00:00.123456789'::timestamp - INTERVAL '24' HOUR;
    -- Result: 2022-03-13 01:00:00.123456789
    ```

## Precision loss & limitations

Nanosecond precision is lost (truncated to microseconds or discarded) under the following scenarios:

- Converting timestamp to types with lower precision:
    - timestamptz
    - time
    - date

- Subtracting Timestamps (timestamp - timestamp): The result is an interval, which only has microsecond precision.
    ```sql Subtract two timestamps
    SELECT '2022-03-13 03:00:00.123456789'::timestamp - '2022-03-13 01:00:00.000000000'::timestamp;
    -- Result: 02:00:00.123456 (Note that nanosecond precision is truncated.)
    ```
