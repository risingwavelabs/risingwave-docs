| Type | Aliases | Description | Value |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| boolean | bool | Logical Boolean.  <br/>It follows a three-valued logic system (true, false, or null). | true, false, or null |
| smallint |     | Two-byte integer | Range: -32768 to 32767 |
| integer | int | Four-byte integer | Range: -2147483648 to 2147483647 |
| bigint |     | Eight-byte integer | Range: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 |
| numeric | decimal | Exact numeric.  <br/>We do not support specifying precision and scale as of now. | Precision: 28 decimal digits. Note that the range is smaller compared to PostgreSQL. |
| real |     | Single precision floating-point number (4 bytes) | Range: 6 decimal digits precision |
| double precision | double | Double precision floating-point number (8 bytes) | Range: 15 decimal digits precision |
| character varying | varchar, string | Variable-length character string.  <br/>We do not support specifying the maximum length as of now. | Example: `'Hello World!'` |
| bytea |     | [Binary strings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-binary.html).  <br/>RisingWave only supports the hex formats for input and output; the escape format is not supported yet. | Syntax: `' \x binary_string '`  <br/>Example: `'\xDe00BeEf'` |
| date |     | Calendar date (year, month, day) | Example: `date '2022-04-08'` |
| time without time zone | time | Time of day (no time zone) | Example: `time '18:20:49'` |
| timestamp without time zone | timestamp | Date and time (no time zone) | Example: `'2022-03-13 01:00:00'::timestamp` |
| timestamp with time zone | timestamptz | Timestamp with time zone.  <br/>The 'Z' stands for UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Timestamptz values are stored in UTC. When sinking downstream, timestamptz is represented in i64 with a resolution of microseconds. | Example: `'2022-03-13 01:00:00Z'::timestamptz` |
| interval |     | Time span.  <br/>Input in string format. Units include: second/seconds/s, minute/minutes/min/m, hour/hours/hr/h, day/days/d, month/months/mon, and year/years/yr/y. Units smaller than second can only be specified in a numerical format. | Examples: `interval '4 hour'` → `04:00:00`  <br/>`interval '3 day'` → `3 days 00:00:00`  <br/>`interval '04:00:00.1234'` → `04:00:00.1234` |
| struct |     | A struct is a column that contains nested data. | For syntax and examples, see [Struct](/sql/data-types/struct). |
| array |     | An array is an ordered list of zero or more elements that share the same data type. | For syntax and examples, see [Array](/sql/data-types/array-type). |
| map |     | A map contains key-value pairs. | For syntax and examples, see [Map](/sql/data-types/map-type). |
| JSONB |     | A (binary) JSON value that ignores semantically-insignificant whitespaces or order of object keys. | For syntax and examples, see [JSONB](/sql/data-types/jsonb). |
| vector | | Fixed-length vector with n dimensions for similarity search operations. | For syntax and examples, see [Vector](/sql/data-types/vector). |

<Note>
Scientific notation (e.g., 1e6, 1.25e5, and 1e-4) is supported in SELECT and INSERT statements.
