title: "CREATE VIEW"
description: "Use the `CREATE VIEW` command to create a non-materialized view, which runs every time the view is referenced in a query. A non-materialized view can be created based on sources, tables, views, or indexes."
---

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] view_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] AS select_query;
```

## Parameters
| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _mv\_name_      | The name of the view to be created.                                                                                                         |
| _column\_name_  | Specify the columns of the view.                                                                                                            |
| _select\_query_ | A SELECT query that retrieves data for the view. See [SELECT](/sql/commands/sql-select) for the syntax and examples of the SELECT command. |

## Examples

The following statements create views based a plain table and a table with connector settings, and then create a new view based on the existing views. 
The data for the table is generated by the built-in [load generator](/ingestion/advanced/generate-test-data).

```sql
-- Create a table and add some records.

CREATE TABLE t1 (a int, b int, c int);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (115, 1, 8), (585, 2, 3), (601, 3, 7);

-- Create a source (whose data is generated by the built-in generator).

CREATE TABLE s1 (i1 int, c1 varchar)
WITH (
     connector = 'datagen',
     fields.i1.kind = 'sequence',
     fields.i1.start = '1',
     fields.c1.kind = 'random',
     fields.c1.length = '16',
     fields.c1.seed = '3',
     datagen.rows.per.second = '10'
 ) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;

-- Create views based on the table, source, and existing views.

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS v1 (a1, b1) AS SELECT a, b FROM t1;

CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM s1 ORDER BY i1;

CREATE VIEW v3 AS SELECT a1, i1, c1 FROM v1 LEFT JOIN v2 ON v1.b1=v2.i1;
```

Let's query view `v3`.

```bash
SELECT * FROM v3;
```

```bash
 a1  | i1 |        c1
