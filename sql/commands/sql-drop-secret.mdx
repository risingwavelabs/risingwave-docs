## Hanging or long running `DROP SECRET`

If your `DROP SECRET` command takes a long time to run, it could be due to high barrier latency. `DROP` commands need to be synchronized with barriers currently. To let `DROP` take effect immediately, you can use the `RECOVER` command in a separate session.
