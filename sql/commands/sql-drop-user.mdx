## Parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IF EXISTS** | Do not return an error if the specified user does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| _user\_name_  | The user you want to drop.  \- You cannot drop the current user;  \- To drop a superuser (user with the SUPERUSER privilege), you must be a superuser yourself;  \- To drop a non-superuser, you must have the CREATEUSER privilege. \- The `rwadmin` user cannot be dropped as it is reserved for cloud control plane operations. |

## Examples[](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following statement removes the user with the name "user1".

```sql
DROP USER user1;
```

## Hanging or long running `DROP USER`

If your `DROP USER` command takes a long time to run, it could be due to high barrier latency. `DROP` commands need to be synchronized with barriers currently. To let `DROP` take effect immediately, you can use the `RECOVER` command in a separate session.
