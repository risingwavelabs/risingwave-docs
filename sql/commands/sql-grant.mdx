ON {  sink_name [, ...]
    | ALL SINKS IN SCHEMA schema_name [, ...] }
TO user_name [WITH GRANT OPTION] [GRANTED BY user_name];
```

Grant materialized view privileges to a user.

```sql
GRANT {SELECT | ALL [PRIVILEGES]}
ON {MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name [, ...]
    | ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN SCHEMA schema_name [, ...] }

| **GRANTED BY** clause        | The specified user after the GRANTED BY clause must be the current user. By default, the current user is root. |

## Example

Grant all privileges for all sources in `schema1` to user `user1`.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
ON ALL SOURCES IN SCHEMA schema1
TO user1 GRANTED BY user;
```

Grant the SELECT privilege for materialized view `mv1`, which is in schema `schema1` of database `db1`, to user `user1`. `user1` is able to grant the SELECT privilege other users.

```sql
GRANT SELECT
ON MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 IN SCHEMA db1.schema1
TO user1 WITH GRANT OPTION GRANTED BY user;
```

Grant the SELECT privileges for source `s1` to user `user1`.

```sql
GRANT SELECT
