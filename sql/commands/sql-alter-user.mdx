## Parameters

| Parameter or clause  | Description                                                                                                             |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _user\_name_         | The name of the user to be modified.                                                                                    |
| _new\_user\_name_    | The new name of the user.                                                                                               |
| _system\_permission_ | See [the options for system permissions of the CREATE USER command](/sql/commands/sql-create-user#syntax-for-creating-a-new-user). |

<Note>
The `rwadmin` user cannot be altered, renamed, or dropped except for password changes made by the `rwadmin` user itself. This restriction ensures system security for cloud control plane operations.
</Note>

For the alter user authentication method, the `jwks_url` and `issuer` parameters are mandatory. On the other hand, `other_params_should_match` is an optional parameter that will be validated against `jwt.claims`. Ensure that all keys in the options are in **lowercase**.

<Note>
`kid` and `alg` are required in the header of JWT, and `kid` is also required in the JWKs returned by the JWKS server. All parameters set in user creation (except `jwks_url`) will be checked in the claims of JWT. Any mismatch will deny the login process.
</Note>

## Examples

The following statement renames the user `user1` to `user001`.

```sql
ALTER USER user1 RENAME TO user001;
```

The following statement modifies the password and privileges of `user001`.

```sql
ALTER USER user001 NOSUPERUSER CREATEDB PASSWORD '4d2Df1ee5';
```
