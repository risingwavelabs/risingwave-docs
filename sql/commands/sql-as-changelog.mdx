title: "AS CHANGELOG"
description: "Use the `AS CHANGELOG` clause to convert a changelog operation in a stream into a column."
---

This can be used to create materialized views and sinks. See the practice in [Sink data with upsert in Snowflake](/integrations/destinations/snowflake#sink-data-with-upsert).

The AS CHANGELOG clause adds two metadata columns:

- `changelog_op`: the change type (`1` = Insert, `2` = Delete, `3` = UpdateInsert, `4` = UpdateDelete)  
- `_changelog_row_id`: a monotonically increasing identifier that captures the order of the change.

## Syntax

```sql
WITH table_name AS CHANGELOG FROM source_table;
```

This is done using the CTE syntax. It converts the `source_table` change record to a column of `table_name`.

## Example

```sql Create MV
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ss_mv AS
WITH sub AS CHANGELOG FROM user_behaviors
SELECT
    user_id,
    target_id,
    event_timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'America/Indiana/Indianapolis' AS event_timestamp,
    changelog_op AS __op,
    _changelog_row_id::bigint AS __row_id
FROM
    sub;
```

```sql Changelog operation
INSERT INTO user_behaviors (v1, v2) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO user_behaviors (v1, v2) VALUES (2, 2);

DELETE FROM user_behaviors WHERE v1 = 2;

UPDATE user_behaviors SET v2 = 100 WHERE v1 = 1;

```

```sql Query MV
SELECT * FROM ss_mv;

-------RESULT
v1  v2  changelog_op
1   1   1
2   2   1
2   2   2
1   1   4
1   100 3
```
