title: "SHOW SINKS"
description: "Use the `SHOW SINKS` command to return a list of all sinks."
---

## Syntax

```bash
SHOW SINKS [ FROM schema_name ] [ LIKE_expression ];
```

## Parameters

| Clause | Description      |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| schema\_name |The schema of the sinks to be listed.|
| LIKE\_expression    | Filters the output based on names by applying pattern matching. See details in [LIKE pattern matching expressions](/sql/functions/string#like-pattern-matching-expressions). |

## Example

```bash
SHOW SINKS;
```

## Notes

Starting from a recent version, the `name` column in the output includes the schema name as a prefix (e.g., `public.sink_name`). This helps distinguish sinks with the same name in different schemas when querying across multiple schemas in the search path.
