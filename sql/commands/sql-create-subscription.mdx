title: "CREATE SUBSCRIPTION"
description: "Use the `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` command to create a subscription. A subscription allows you to subscribe to real-time updates from tables and materialized views without external event stores like Kafka."
---

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name FROM table_or_mv_name WITH (
    retention = 'duration'
);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| _subscription\_name_ | The name of the subscription to create. |
| _table\_or\_mv\_name_ | The name of the table or materialized view to subscribe to. |
| _retention_ | The duration for which incremental data will be retained, provided as a string in the format of an interval (e.g., '1D', '2h', '30m'). Any incremental data that exceeds the specified retention duration will be automatically deleted and will no longer be accessible. |

## Example

```sql
-- Create a subscription on a table
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub_users FROM users WITH (retention = '1D');

-- Create a subscription on a materialized view
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub_mv FROM my_materialized_view WITH (retention = '2h');
```
