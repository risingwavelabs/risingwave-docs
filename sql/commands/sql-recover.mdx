title: "RECOVER"
description: "Use the `RECOVER` command to trigger an ad-hoc recovery manually. This is helpful when there is a high barrier latency and you need to force a recovery to activate. By doing this, commands like `CANCEL` or `DROP` can take effect immediately."

It requires superuser permissions, see [CREATE USER](/sql/commands/sql-create-user) on how to do so.

```bash Syntax
RECOVER;
```

```bash Syntax
