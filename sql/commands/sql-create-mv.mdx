title: "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW"
description: "Use the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` command to create a materialized view. A materialized view can be created based on sources, tables, materialized views, or indexes."
---

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] mv_name
[ WITH ( parameter = value [, ... ] ) ]
AS select_query;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter or clause | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mv_name          | The name of the materialized view to be created.                                                                                                         |
| select_query     | A SELECT query that retrieves data for the materialized view. See [SELECT](/sql/commands/sql-select) for the syntax and examples of the SELECT command. |
| WITH clause     | Specifies optional parameters for the materialized view. For example, [`source_rate_limit`](/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-oom#oom-when-creating-materialized-views) to set the ingestion rate, and [`backfill_order`](/sql/commands/sql-create-mv#backfill-behavior-and-controls) to control the backfill order. |

<Note>
Names and unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive. Therefore, you must double-quote any of these fields for them to be case-sensitive. See also [Identifiers](/sql/identifiers).
</Note>

<Note>
The `ORDER BY` clause in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement is allowed but not considered as part of the definition of the materialized view. It's only used in the initial creation of the materialized view and not during refreshes.
</Note>

## Backfill behavior and controls

1. `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` will first **backfill** historical data from the referenced relations, and completion time varies based on the volume of data to be backfilled.

2. To perform the operations in the background, you can execute `SET BACKGROUND_DDL=true;` before running the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement. See details in [SET BACKGROUND\_DDL](/sql/commands/sql-set-background-ddl).

3. You can specify `backfill_order` in the `WITH` clause to control the backfill order for different upstream relations. Use the `->` operator to define dependencies between tables. The left relation will be fully backfilled before the right relation begins.

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW m1
    WITH (backfill_order = FIXED(t1 -> t2, t2 -> t3))
    AS
    SELECT v1 FROM t1
    UNION
    SELECT v1 FROM t2
    UNION
    SELECT v1 FROM t3;
    ```

    To view progress of each backfill fragment:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM rw_catalog.rw_fragment_backfill_progress;
    ```

    To inspect the structure of the running streaming job:
    ```sql
    DESCRIBE FRAGMENTS <mv name>;
    ```

    To dump a `dot` formatted graph of your backfill orders:

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN (backfill, format dot) CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...;
    ```

    <Note>
    - The `backfill_order` feature is currently in **technical preview** stage.
    - It is supported only for `MATERIALIZED VIEW`.
    - Backfill order recovery is not supported for background ddl. If a backfilling job restarts, the specified order will be lost, and all tables will backfill concurrently.
    - Cross-database scans inside the `backfill_order` clause are not supported.
