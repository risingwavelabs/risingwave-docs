## Parameters

| Parameter or clause   | Description                                                                                                    |

## Revoke privileges on future objects 

To revoke privileges that would automatically apply to future objects created by a user, use the [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](/sql/commands/sql-alter-default-privileges) command. This removes the need to revoke permissions manually for each new object.

## Example

Revoke all privileges for all sources in `schema1` from user `user1`.

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES
ON ALL SOURCES IN SCHEMA schema1
FROM user1 GRANTED BY user;
```

REVOKE the SELECT privilege for materialized view `mv1`, which is in schema `schema1` of database `db1`, from user `user1`.

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 IN SCHEMA db1.schema1
FROM user1;
```

Revoke the SELECT privilege for source `s1` from user `user1`.

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON SOURCE s1
FROM user1;
```
