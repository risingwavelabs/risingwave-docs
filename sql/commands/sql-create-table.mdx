title: "CREATE TABLE"
description: "Use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a new table. Tables consist of fixed columns and insertable rows. "
---

Rows can be added using the [INSERT](/sql/commands/sql-insert) command. When creating a table, you can specify connector settings and data format.

<Note>


If you choose not to persist the data from the source in RisingWave, use [CREATE SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-create-source) instead. For more details about the differences between sources and tables, see [here](/ingestion/overview#table-with-connectors).
</Note>

## Syntax

```js
CREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (
    col_name data_type [ PRIMARY KEY ] [ DEFAULT default_expr ] [ AS generation_expression ],
    ...
    [ PRIMARY KEY (col_name, ... ) ]
    [ watermark_clause ]
)
[ APPEND ONLY ]
[ ON CONFLICT conflict_action ]
[INCLUDE { header | key | offset | partition | timestamp } [AS <column_name>]]
[ WITH (
    connector='connector_name',
    connector_parameter='value', ...)]
[FORMAT data_format ENCODE data_encode [ (
    message='message',
    schema.location='location', ...) ]
]
[ ENGINE = iceberg ];
```

## Notes

- For tables with primary key constraints, if you insert a new data record with an existing key, the new record will overwrite the existing record.

- A [generated column](/sql/query-syntax/generated-columns) that is defined with non-deterministic functions cannot be specified as part of the primary key. For example, if `A1` is defined as `current_timestamp()`, then it cannot be part of the primary key.

- Names and unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive. Therefore, you must double-quote any of these fields for them to be case-sensitive. See also [Identifiers](/sql/identifiers).

- The syntax for creating a table with connector settings and the supported connectors are the same as for creating a source. See [CREATE SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-create-source) for a full list of supported connectors and data formats.

- To know when a data record is loaded to RisingWave, you can define a column that is generated based on the processing time (`<column_name> timestamptz AS proctime()`) when creating the table or source. See also [proctime()](/sql/functions/datetime#proctime).

- For a table with schema from external connector, use `*` to represent all columns from the external connector first, so that you can define a generated column on table with an external connector. Alternatively, you can partially combine the schema with generated columns or apply the schema directly to define the table structure. See the examples below:

  ```sql
  -- Use * to represent all columns
  CREATE TABLE from_kafka (
    *,
    gen_i32_field INT AS int32_field + 2,
    PRIMARY KEY (some_key)
  )
  INCLUDE KEY AS some_key
  [INCLUDE { header | offset | partition | timestamp } [AS <column_name>]]
  WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'test-rw-sink-upsert-avro',
    properties.bootstrap.server = 'message_queue:29092'
  )
  FORMAT upsert ENCODE AVRO (
    schema.registry = 'http://message_queue:8081'
  );

  -- Specify partial schema
  CREATE TABLE t2 (bar INT, gen_col INT AS bar + 1)
  WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'test-rw-sink-upsert-avro',
    properties.bootstrap.server = 'message_queue:29092'
  )
  FORMAT upsert ENCODE AVRO (
    schema.registry = 'http://message_queue:8081'
  );
  ```

## Parameters

| Parameter or clause               | Description   |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------ |
| table\_name                       | The name of the table. If a schema name is given (for example, CREATE TABLE \<schema>.\<table> ...), then the table is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| col\_name                         | The name of a column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| data\_type                        | The data type of a column. With the struct data type, you can create a nested table. Elements in a nested table need to be enclosed with angle brackets (\<>).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| DEFAULT                           | The DEFAULT clause allows you to assign a default value to a column. This default value is used when a new row is inserted, and no explicit value is provided for that column. default\_expr is any constant value or variable-free expression that does not reference other columns in the current table or involve subqueries. The data type of default\_expr must match the data type of the column. |
| generation\_expression            | The expression for the generated column. For details about generated columns, see [Generated columns](/sql/query-syntax/generated-columns).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| watermark\_clause                 | A clause that defines the watermark for a timestamp column. The syntax is WATERMARK FOR column\_name as expr. For the watermark clause to be valid, the table must be an append-only table. That is, the APPEND ONLY option must be specified. This restriction only applies to a table. For details about watermarks, See [Watermarks](#watermarks) below for more.           |
| APPEND ONLY                       | When this option is specified, the table will be created as an append-only table. An append-only table cannot have primary keys. UPDATE and DELETE statements are not valid for append-only tables. See [Watermarks](#append-only) below for more.                                                                            |
| ON CONFLICT                       | Specify the alternative action when the newly inserted record brings a violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint on the table. See [PK conflict behavior](#pk-conflict-behavior) below for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **INCLUDE** clause                | Extract fields not included in the payload as separate columns. For more details on its usage, see [INCLUDE clause](/ingestion/ingest-additional-fields-with-include-clause).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **WITH** clause                   | Specify the connector settings here if trying to store all the source data. See the [Data ingestion](/ingestion/overview) page for the full list of supported source as well as links to specific connector pages detailing the syntax for each source.                                                                                                                                       |
| **FORMAT** and **ENCODE** options | Specify the data format and the encoding format of the source data. To learn about the supported data formats, see [Data formats](/ingestion/supported-sources-and-formats#supported-formats).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **ENGINE** | Specify the Iceberg table engine to store data natively in the Iceberg format. For more information, see [Create a table with the Iceberg engine](/store/iceberg-table-engine#3-create-a-table-with-the-iceberg-engine).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<Note>
Please distinguish between the parameters set in the FORMAT and ENCODE options and those set in the WITH clause. Ensure that you place them correctly and avoid any misuse.
</Note>

## Append only

The append-only table does not support delete or update operations, nor does it support non-append-only upstream connectors. There are two main reasons for using append-only tables:

- Certain features are exclusively available for append-only tables, such as watermark and TTL (Time-To-Live).
- Streaming jobs created downstream from append-only tables can leverage their append-only property to optimize performance. 


## Use Iceberg table engine

In a `CREATE TABLE` statement, you can specify `ENGINE = iceberg` to store table data in the Apache Iceberg format on external object storage. This provides an alternative to RisingWave’s default internal row-based storage, making it easier to persist data for long-term use and cross-system access. For more information on the syntax and usage, see [Iceberg table engine](/store/iceberg-table-engine).

## Watermarks

RisingWave supports generating watermarks when creating an append-only streaming table. Watermarks are like markers or signals that track the progress of event time, allowing you to process events within their corresponding time windows. For more information on the syntax on how to create a watermark, see [Watermarks](/processing/watermarks).

## TTL of append-only table

Data in an append-only table cannot be deleted with `DELETE` statements. Therefore, RisingWave provides TTL (Time-To-Live) feature to automatically clean up expired data in the table. 
However, please note that this cleanup only applies to the data within the table itself—it does not affect downstream materialized views or other streaming jobs. If you need to clean up data in downstream materialized views used in queries, you should use a [Temporal Filter](/processing/sql/temporal-filters) in the downstream streaming job.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (
    ...
) APPEND ONLY WITH (retention_seconds = 86400);
```

## PK conflict behavior

The record with insert operation could introduce duplicate records with the same primary key in the table. In that case, an alternative action specified by the `ON CONFLICT conflict_action` clause will be adopted. The record can come from `INSERT` statement, external connectors of the table, or [sinks into the table](/sql/commands/sql-create-sink-into).

The `conflict_action` could one of the following. A [version column](#version-column) can be specified together for `DO UPDATE FULL` and `DO UPDATE IF NOT NULL`. When version column is specified, the insert operation will take effect only when the newly inserted row's version column is greater or equal than the existing row's version column, and is not NULL.

* `IGNORE`: Ignore the newly inserted record.
* `OVERWRITE [WITH VERSION COLUMN(col_name)]`: Full update: replace the existing row in the table with the new row.
* `DO UPDATE IF NOT NULL [WITH VERSION COLUMN(col_name)]`: Partial update: only replace those fields with non-NULL values in the inserted row. NULL values in the inserted row means unchanged in this case.

<Note>
The delete and update operation on the table cannot break the primary key constraint on the table, so the option will not take effect for those cases.
</Note>

<Note>
When `DO UPDATE IF NOT NULL` behavior is applied, `DEFAULT` clause is not allowed on the table's columns.
</Note>

### Version column

A version column is a non-primary-key column that can be used with `OVERWRITE` and `DO UPDATE IF NOT NULL` to tune the conflict behaviors.

Common use cases include:
1. Use a event time column as version column to ensure temporal ordering and ignore late-arriving data.
2. Use an integer as a logical version number. You can use a Upsert-then-Delete pattern with a logical version column to implement "zero-downtime incremental version upgrade" for data in the table: you insert a new version of data with a higher version number while keeping old data, and then after finishing the upgrade, you clean up old data with a `DELETE` statement.

    This can be used to implement [in-place streaming job modification](/operate/alter-streaming#modifying-a-streaming-job-in-place), or re-sync external batch data into RisingWave (reverse ETL).

    Note: When a row is updated with only a new version number, but other columns unchanged, downstream streaming jobs depending on the table won't be affected if they do not use the version column. RisingWave will
    automatically compact "no-op" updates to prevent massive updates for downstream jobs. You can create a logical view with `SELECT * EXCEPT(version_col)` to avoid depending on the version column by mistake.

## Example

The statement below creates a table that has three columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE taxi_trips(
    id VARCHAR,
    distance DOUBLE PRECISION,
    city VARCHAR
);
```

The statement below creates a table that includes nested tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS taxi_trips(
    id VARCHAR,
    distance DOUBLE PRECISION,
    duration DOUBLE PRECISION,
    fare STRUCT<
      initial_charge DOUBLE PRECISION,
      subsequent_charge DOUBLE PRECISION,
      surcharge DOUBLE PRECISION,
      tolls DOUBLE PRECISION>);
```

The statement below creates a table with a Kafka broker as the source.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_abc (
   column1 varchar,
   column2 integer,
)
WITH (
   connector='kafka',
   topic='demo_topic',
   properties.bootstrap.server='172.10.1.1:9090,172.10.1.2:9090',
   scan.startup.mode='latest',
   scan.startup.timestamp_millis='140000000',
) FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```
