Before you can drop a connection, you must remove all its dependent sources and sinks.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP CONNECTION [ IF EXISTS ] connection_name [ CASCADE ];
```

## Parameters
| Parameter or clause | Description                               |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| _connection\_name_  | The name of the connection to be removed. |
| **CASCADE** option   | If this option is specified, all objects (such as tables and sinks) that depend on the connection, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects will be dropped. **Not supported for Iceberg connections.**                                                                                                           |
