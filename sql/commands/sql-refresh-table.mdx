title: "REFRESH TABLE"
description: "Use the `REFRESH TABLE` command to manually trigger a refresh operation for tables created with the FULL_RECOMPUTE refresh mode."
---

<Note>
Added in v2.7.0. It is currently in **[technical preview](/changelog/product-lifecycle#product-release-lifecycle)** stage.
</Note>

The `REFRESH TABLE` command manually triggers a full reload of data from the external source for tables configured with the `FULL_RECOMPUTE` refresh mode. This command is required to load data into the table for the first time and can be used anytime you need to update the table data with the latest snapshot from the external source.

When a table is created with `refresh_mode = 'FULL_RECOMPUTE'`, it does not automatically load data. You must explicitly execute `REFRESH TABLE` to pull data from the external Iceberg table. Each refresh pulls the latest Iceberg snapshot and applies any delete files (PositionDeletes and EqualityDeletes) to ensure accurate query results.

## Syntax

```sql
REFRESH TABLE table_name;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `table_name` | The name of the table to refresh. The table must be created with `refresh_mode = 'FULL_RECOMPUTE'`. |

## Example

Create a table with the `FULL_RECOMPUTE` refresh mode:

```sql
CREATE TABLE iceberg_batch_table (
    id int primary key,
    name varchar
) WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    catalog.type = 'storage',
    warehouse.path = 's3://hummock001/iceberg_connection',
    table.name = 'my_iceberg_table',
    database.name = 'public',
    s3.access.key = secret my_secret,
    s3.secret.key = secret my_secret,
    s3.endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:9301',
    s3.region = 'us-west-2',
    refresh_mode = 'FULL_RECOMPUTE'
);
```

Manually trigger a refresh:

```sql
REFRESH TABLE iceberg_batch_table;
```

## Monitor refresh status

You can monitor the status of refresh operations using the `rw_catalog.rw_refresh_table_state` system catalog:

```sql
SELECT table_id, current_status, last_trigger_time, last_success_time
FROM rw_catalog.rw_refresh_table_state;
```

This query returns information about all refreshable tables, including:
- `table_id`: The unique identifier of the table
- `current_status`: The current status of the refresh job (e.g., `IDLE`, `REFRESHING`)
- `last_trigger_time`: The timestamp of the last refresh operation
- `last_success_time`: The timestamp when the refresh last completed successfully
