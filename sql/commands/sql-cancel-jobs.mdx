title: "CANCEL JOBS"
description: "Use `CANCEL JOBS/JOB` to cancel specific streaming jobs that are in progress."
---
A streaming job is a job that creates an index, a materialized view, a table, a sink, or a source with connectors. You need to specify the IDs of the jobs that you want to cancel. You can use [SHOW JOBS](/sql/commands/sql-show-jobs) to get the IDs of the jobs that are in progress.

## Syntax

```sql
CANCEL [ JOBS | JOB ] job_id [,...];
```

## Examples

```sqlShow all jobs
SHOW JOBS;
------RESULT
  Id  |                     Statement                     | Progress
------+---------------------------------------------------+----------
 1010 | CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv3 AS SELECT *FROM mv1  | 2.21%
 1012 | CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv2 AS SELECT* FROM mv1  | 0.86%
```

```sql Cancel jobs
CANCEL JOBS 1010, 1012;
------RESULT
Id
------
 1012
 1010

```

## Hanging or long running `CANCEL JOBS`

If your `CANCEL JOBS` command takes a long time to run, it could be due to high barrier latency. `CANCEL JOBS` commands need to be synchronized with barriers currently. To let `CANCEL JOBS` take effect immediately, you can use the `RECOVER` command in a separate session.
