title: "DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW"
description: "Use the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` command to remove a materialized view from the database."
---

Before you can remove a materialzied view, you must remove all its dependent materialzied views.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] [schema_name.]mv_name [ CASCADE ];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _schema\_name_     | Specify the name of a schema to remove the materialized view in that schema. You can use [SHOW SCHEMAS](/sql/commands/sql-show-schemas) to get a list of all available schemas. If you don't specify a schema, the specified materialized view in the default schema public will be removed. |
| _mv\_name_         | The name of the materialized view to remove. You can use [SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS](/sql/commands/sql-show-mv) to get a list of all available materialized views.                                                                                                                             |
| **CASCADE** option | If this option is specified, all objects (such as other materialized views or regular views) that depend on the materialized view, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects will be dropped.                                                                                      |

## Examples

This statement removes the `ad_ctr_5min` materialized view in the default schema (`public`) from the database:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW ad_ctr_5min;
```

This statement removes the `ad_ctr_5min` materialized view in the `rw_schema` schema from the database:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS rw_schema.ad_ctr_5min;
```

## Hanging or long running `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW`

If your `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` command takes a long time to run, it could be due to high barrier latency. `DROP` commands need to be synchronized with barriers currently. To let `DROP` take effect immediately, you can use the `RECOVER` command in a separate session.
