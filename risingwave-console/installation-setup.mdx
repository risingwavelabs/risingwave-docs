This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up RisingWave Console. RisingWave Console requires a PostgreSQL database to store its metadata (like cluster connection details). You can use a bundled PostgreSQL for quick setup or connect to your own existing instance.

## Key configuration variables

Before you begin, be aware of these key environment variables that RisingWave Console uses:

*   `RCONSOLE_PORT`: (Optional) Specifies the port on which the RisingWave Console server will listen. Defaults to `8020`.
*   `RCONSOLE_PG_DSN`: (Required for binary and Docker Compose with external PG) The PostgreSQL connection string for RisingWave Console's metadata database.
    *   Format: `postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>`
    *   It's important to note that this database is used by RisingWave Console to store its own operational data and does *not* store your RisingWave cluster's user data.
*   `RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD`: (Optional) Sets the initial password for the `root` user in the RisingWave Console UI. If not set, it defaults to `root`. It's recommended to set this for any persistent deployment.
*   `RCONSOLE_RISECTLDIR`: (Optional) May be used by RisingWave Console if it needs to locate `risectl` resources for executing commands against your RisingWave cluster. The default behavior usually suffices.

## System requirements

*   **Memory**: Minimum 512MB RAM (1GB recommended)
*   **Storage**: At least 1GB free disk space
*   **Architecture**: x86_64 and ARM64 are supported
*   **Network**: Port 8020 (or your custom port) must be accessible

## Option 1: Quick setup with docker (bundled PostgreSQL)

This is the fastest way to try RisingWave Console. The `risingwavelabs/risingwave-console:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle` image includes a PostgreSQL server and is hosted on Docker Hub. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the desired RisingWave Console version (for example, `v0.4.0`).

<Note>
**Security Note**: For production deployments, always set a strong `RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD` and ensure the console is not exposed to public networks without proper authentication.
</Note>

- Ephemeral storage (for testing only)
  
  All RisingWave Console metadata will be lost if the container is removed.

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 --name risingwave-console risingwavelabs/risingwave-console:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```
   To set a custom root password:
   ```shell
   docker run --rm -p 8020:8020 -e RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password --name risingwave-console risingwavelabs/risingwave-console:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```

- Persistent storage (recommended for standalone Docker)
  
  RisingWave Console metadata is stored in a Docker volume (`risingwave-console-data`), ensuring data persists across container restarts or recreations.

   ```shell
   docker run -d -p 8020:8020 --name risingwave-console \
     -e RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
     -v risingwave-console-data:/var/lib/postgresql \
     risingwavelabs/risingwave-console:vX.Y.Z-pgbundle
   ```

## Option 2: Setup with binary (requires external PostgreSQL)

This method uses a standalone RisingWave Console binary and requires you to have a separate, running PostgreSQL database.

1.  Download and install the latest RisingWave Console binary:
    ```shell
    curl https://risingwave-console-release.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/download.sh | sh
    ```
2.  Ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible and set the `RCONSOLE_PG_DSN` environment variable. Then, run RisingWave Console:
    ```shell
    RCONSOLE_PG_DSN="postgres://your_user:your_pass@your_pg_host:5432/dbname" \
    RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD="your_secure_password" \
    ./risingwave-console

    ```
    (Adjust `RCONSOLE_PG_DSN` and `RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD` accordingly.)

## Option 3: Recommended setup (docker compose with external PostgreSQL)

This method uses Docker Compose to run RisingWave Console and allows you to easily manage it alongside your own PostgreSQL instance (either also as a Docker container or an external one).

1.  Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      risingwave-console:
        image: risingwavelabs/risingwave-console:vX.Y.Z # Use the image without -pgbundle
        ports:
          - "8020:8020" # Or your RCONSOLE_PORT
        environment:
          RCONSOLE_PORT: 8020 # Optional, if different from default
          RCONSOLE_PG_DSN: postgres://postgres_user:postgres_password@db_host:5432/risingwave_console_metadata_db # IMPORTANT: Point to your PG
          RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_secure_password
          # RCONSOLE_RISECTLDIR: /path/if/needed
        depends_on:
          - db # Only if PostgreSQL is also managed by this Docker Compose file

      # Example: If running PostgreSQL in Docker Compose as well
      db:
        image: "postgres:15" # Or your preferred version
        ports:
          - "5432:5432" # Expose if needed externally, otherwise RisingWave Console connects via Docker network
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres_user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres_password
          POSTGRES_DB: risingwave_console_metadata_db
        volumes:
          - postgres_risingwave_console_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    volumes:
      postgres_risingwave_console_data: # For the PostgreSQL container
    ```
    Note:
    *   Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the specific RisingWave Console version (for example, `v0.4.0`).
    *   Adjust `RCONSOLE_PG_DSN` to point to your PostgreSQL instance. If `db` is a service in the same Docker Compose, you can use `db_host: db`.
    *   Update PostgreSQL credentials and database name.

2.  Start RisingWave Console:
    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Verifying the installation

After starting RisingWave Console, check its logs to ensure it started without errors:
*   If using Docker/Docker Compose: `docker logs risingwave-console` (or your service name).
*   If using binary: Observe the terminal output.

## Finding the latest version

To find the latest available version of RisingWave Console:
*   **Docker Hub**: Visit [risingwavelabs/risingwave-console](https://hub.docker.com/r/risingwavelabs/risingwave-console) on Docker Hub
*   **GitHub Releases**: Check the [RisingWave Console releases page](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-console/releases)

## Troubleshooting common issues

*   **Port already in use**: If port 8020 is occupied, change `RCONSOLE_PORT` to an available port (e.g., `8021`)
*   **Connection refused**: Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
*   **Permission denied**: Check that the user has appropriate permissions to access the PostgreSQL database
*   **Container fails to start**: Verify that the Docker image name and version are correct

## Initial login and dashboard overview

1.  Access RisingWave Console UI: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8020` (or the host/port you configured).
2.  Login:
    *   Username: `root`
    *   Password: The password you set via `RCONSOLE_ROOT_PASSWORD`, or `root` if not set.
3.  Dashboard: Upon successful login, you'll see the RisingWave Console dashboard. This is your main entry point to:
    *   Manage **Clusters**: For connecting to your RisingWave instances.
    *   Use the **SQL Console**: For querying your RisingWave data.
    *   Access links to external resources and documentation.
