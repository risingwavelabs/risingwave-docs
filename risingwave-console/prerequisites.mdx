Before installing RisingWave Console, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites for the RisingWave Console host, its metadata database, and the target RisingWave clusters.

## For the RisingWave Console host machine

The machine where you install and run the RisingWave Console server itself needs:

*   Supported operating system:
    *   If using Docker: Any OS that can run a modern Docker daemon (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL2).
    *   If using the binary: A compatible Linux distribution (as specified by the binary release, typically x86_64).
*   Docker (if using Docker installation methods): A recent version of Docker installed and running.
*   Resources: As a web application that connects to external services, RisingWave Console itself is relatively lightweight. Ensure the host has sufficient resources to run the RisingWave Console process (or Docker container) and its bundled PostgreSQL if that installation method is chosen. Specific needs may vary based on the number of managed clusters and user activity.
*   Network access:
    *   Outbound internet access to download RisingWave Console images/binaries.
    *   Network connectivity to its PostgreSQL metadata store (local or remote).
    *   Network connectivity to all target RisingWave clusters on their respective ports.

## For the RisingWave Console metadata PostgreSQL database

RisingWave Console uses a PostgreSQL database to store its configuration, such as your RisingWave cluster connection details. It's important to note that this database only stores RisingWave Console's configuration (like your RisingWave cluster connection details) and does *not* store any of your RisingWave cluster's user data.

*   PostgreSQL instance: A running PostgreSQL server.
    *   This can be a self-hosted instance, a cloud-managed PostgreSQL service, or the instance bundled with the `...-pgbundle` Docker image. Consult RisingWave Console release notes or repository for any specific PostgreSQL version recommendations if available.
*   Network accessibility: The RisingWave Console server must be able to connect to this PostgreSQL instance.
*   Database user and permissions: RisingWave Console requires a database and a user with permissions to create and manage tables within that database.
*   Connection string (`RCONSOLE_PG_DSN`): You'll need the DSN (Data Source Name) for RisingWave Console to connect, in the format: `postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>`.

## For target RisingWave clusters

These are the RisingWave clusters you intend to connect to and manage via RisingWave Console:

*   Existing and running: RisingWave Console connects to already operational RisingWave clusters; it does not provision new ones.
*   Network connectivity: The RisingWave Console server must have network access to each RisingWave cluster on the following ports:
    *   RisingWave SQL Port: Typically `4566`.
    *   RisingWave Meta Node Port: Typically `5690`.
    *   RisingWave HTTP Port (on Meta Node): Typically `5691`.
    *   Ensure any firewalls between the RisingWave Console server and your RisingWave clusters allow traffic on these ports.
*   Connection details: You will need the hostnames/IPs and the above port numbers for each RisingWave cluster.
*   Compatible RisingWave versions: RisingWave Console is designed to work with recent versions of RisingWave. Check the RisingWave Console GitHub repository or release notes for specific version compatibility information.
