After [connecting your RisingWave clusters](/risingwave-console/connect-risingwave-clusters) to RisingWave Console, you can use the UI to view their status and access several operational tools provided on the **Cluster Details** page.

## The clusters page

This page lists all RisingWave cluster connections configured in RisingWave Console. For each cluster, you'll typically see its name, status (as reported by RisingWave Console), host, and ports. Actions to **Edit** or **Delete** the connection from RisingWave Console are also available here.

Clicking **Manage** on a cluster panel navigates you to its dedicated **Cluster Details** page.

This page provides an in-depth view and operational tools for the selected RisingWave cluster.

### Cluster information panel

This section displays a summary of the cluster's connection information and its reported status, including: **Name**, **Status**, **Number of Nodes**, **Host**, and configured ports (SQL, Meta Node, HTTP).

### Executing `risectl` commands

RisingWave Console provides an interface to run `risectl` (RisingWave's command-line control utility) commands directly on the selected cluster.

*   How to use: In the **Risectl Command** section, enter the arguments for your `risectl` command (for example, `meta-node list`) into the text area and click **Run Command**. The base `risectl` command is implied.
*   Output: The command's output is displayed within the UI.
*   Purpose: Useful for various administrative and diagnostic tasks supported by `risectl`.
*   Note on `RCONSOLE_RISECTLDIR`: The `RCONSOLE_RISECTLDIR` environment variable may be relevant if RisingWave Console needs to locate `risectl` resources or binaries on its host system.

### Managing metadata snapshots

RisingWave Console facilitates the management of RisingWave cluster metadata snapshots, which are important for backup and recovery.

*   Manual snapshots: The **Create Snapshot** button in the **Metadata Snapshot** section triggers snapshot creation on the RisingWave cluster.
*   Automated backups:
    *   You can enable **Auto Backup** and configure the **Backup Interval** (for example, "Every 30 minutes") and how long snapshots are **Keep For** (for example, "7 days").
*   Viewing snapshots: The UI indicates if snapshots are available.
    *(Note: RisingWave Console helps create these snapshots. The restoration process typically follows standard RisingWave procedures.)*

### Collecting diagnostic information

For advanced troubleshooting, RisingWave Console can assist in collecting diagnostic data from your RisingWave cluster.

*   Manual collection: Use the **Collect Diagnostic** button in the **Diagnostic Information** section.
*   Automated collection:
    *   Enable **Auto Diagnostic** and configure the **Collection Interval** and **Data Retention** period.
*   Accessing data: The UI will show if diagnostic data is available. Refer to RisingWave Console or RisingWave documentation for details on how this data is structured or utilized.

These features on the **Cluster Details** page offer convenient access to important operational tasks for your RisingWave clusters.
